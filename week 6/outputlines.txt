31 MEMOIR OF WILLIAM WELLS BROWN.
1 
1 
72 A narrative of the life of the author of the present work has been most
72 extensively circulated in England and America. The present memoir will,
66 therefore, simply comprise a brief sketch of the most interesting
71 portion of Mr. Brown's history while in America, together with a short
69 account of his subsequent cisatlantic career. The publication of his
68 adventures as a slave, and as a fugitive from slavery in his native
71 land, has been most valuable in sustaining a sound anti-slavery spirit
68 in Great Britain. His honourable reception in Europe may be equally
72 serviceable in America, as another added to the many practical protests
72 previously entered from this side of the Atlantic, against the absolute
67 bondage of three millions and a quarter of the human race, and the
66 semi-slavery involved in the social and political proscription of
46 600,000 free coloured people in that country.
1 
72 William Wells Brown was born at Lexington, in the state of Kentucky, as
71 nearly as he can tell in the autumn of 1814. In the Southern States of
64 America, the pedigree and age of a horse or a dog are carefully
71 preserved, but no record is kept of the birth of a slave. All that Mr.
71 Brown knows upon the subject is traditionally, that he was born "about
73 corn-cutting time" of that year. His mother was a slave named Elizabeth,
73 the property of Dr. Young, a physician. His father was George Higgins, a
24 relative of his master.
1 
71 The name given to our author at his birth, was "William"--no second or
69 surname being permitted to a slave. While William was an infant, Dr.
69 Young removed to Missouri, where, in addition to his profession as a
63 physician, he carried on the--to European notions--incongruous
73 avocations of miller, merchant, and farmer. Here William was employed as
70 a house servant, while his mother was engaged as a field hand. One of
66 his first bitter experiences of the cruelties of slavery, was his
66 witnessing the infliction of ten lashes upon the bare back of his
64 mother, for being a few minutes behind her time at the field--a
61 punishment inflicted with one of those peculiar whips in the
72 construction of which, so as to produce the greatest amount of torture,
73 those whom Lord Carlisle has designated "the chivalry of the South" find
27 scope for their ingenuity.
1 
69 Dr. Young subsequently removed to a farm near St. Louis, in the same
72 State. Having been elected a Member of the Legislature, he devolved the
69 management of his farm upon an overseer, having, what to his unhappy
73 victims must have been the ironical name of "Friend Haskall." The mother
70 and child were now separated. The boy was levied to a Virginian named
67 Freeland, who bore the military title of Major, and carried on the
69 plebeian business of a publican. This man was of an extremely brutal
67 disposition, and treated his slaves with most refined cruelty. His
72 favourite punishment, which he facetiously called "Virginian play," was
70 to flog his slaves severely, and then expose their lacerated flesh to
70 the smoke of tobacco stems, causing the most exquisite agony. William
72 complained to his owner of the treatment of Freeland, but, as in almost
72 all similar instances, the appeal was in vain. At length he was induced
71 to attempt an escape, not from that love of liberty which subsequently
66 became with him an unconquerable passion, but simply to avoid the
68 cruelty to which he was habitually subjected. He took refuge in the
66 woods, but was hunted and "traced" by the blood-hounds of a Major
64 O'Fallon, another of "the chivalry of the South," whose gallant
64 occupation was that of keeping an establishment for the hire of
67 ferocious dogs with which to hunt fugitive slaves. The young slave
68 received a severe application of "Virginia play" for his attempt to
64 escape. Happily the military publican soon afterwards failed in
65 business, and William found a better master and a more congenial
70 employment with Captain Cilvers, on board a steam-boat plying between
71 St. Louis and Galena. At the close of the sailing season he was levied
68 to an hotel-keeper, a native of a free state, but withal of a class
70 which exist north as well as south--a most inveterate negro hater. At
66 this period of William's history, a circumstance occurred, which,
73 although a common incident in the lives of slaves, is one of the keenest
70 trials they have to endure--the breaking up of his family circle. Her
68 master wanted money, and he therefore sold Elizabeth and six of her
67 children to seven different purchasers. The family relationship is
67 almost the only solace of slavery. While the mother, brothers, and
71 sisters are permitted to meet together in the negro hut after the hour
69 of labour, the slaves are comparatively content with their oppressed
70 condition; but deprive them of this, the only privilege which they as
71 human beings are possessed of, and nothing is left but the animal part
72 of their nature--the living soul is extinguished within them. With them
67 there is nothing to love--everything to hate. They feel themselves
68 degraded to the condition not only of mere animals, but of the most
34 ill-used animals in the creation.
1 
71 Not needing the services of his young relative, Dr. Young hired him to
70 the proprietor of the _St. Louis Times_, the best master William ever
65 had in slavery. Here he gained the scanty amount of education he
67 acquired at the South. This kind treatment by his editorial master
70 appears to have engendered in the heart of William a consciousness of
71 his own manhood, and led him into the commission of an offence similar
57 to that perpetrated by Frederick Douglass, under similar
72 circumstances--the assertion of the right of self-defence. He gallantly
70 defended himself against the attacks of several boys older and bigger
68 than himself, but in so doing was guilty of the unpardonable sin of
68 lifting his hand against white lads; and the father of one of them,
72 therefore, deemed it consistent with his manhood to lay in wait for the
67 young slave, and beat him over the head with a heavy cane till the
72 blood gushed from his nose and ears. From the effects of that treatment
73 the poor lad was confined to his bed for five weeks, at the end of which
68 time he found that, to his personal sufferings, were superadded the
64 calamity of the loss of the best master he ever had in slavery.
1 
71 His next employment was that of waiter on board a steam-boat plying on
65 the Mississippi. Here his occupation again was pleasant, and his
71 treatment good; but the freedom of action enjoyed by the passengers in
71 travelling whithersoever they pleased, contrasted strongly in his mind
72 with his own deprivation of will as a slave. The natural result of this
72 comparison was an intense desire for freedom--a feeling which was never
65 afterwards eradicated from his breast. This love of liberty was,
66 however, so strongly counteracted by affection for his mother and
71 sisters, that although urgently entreated by one of the latter to take
73 advantage of his present favourable opportunity for escape, he would not
72 bring himself to do so at the expense of a separation for life from his
19 beloved relatives.
1 
71 His period of living on board the steamer having expired, he was again
70 remitted to field labour, under a burning sun. From that labour, from
72 which he suffered severely, he was soon removed to the lighter and more
72 agreeable occupation of house-waiter to his master. About this time Dr.
72 Young, in the conventional phraseology of the locality, "got religion."
71 The fruit of his alleged spiritual gain, was the loss of many material
70 comforts to the slaves. Destitute of the resources of education, they
71 were in the habit of employing their otherwise unoccupied minds on the
73 Sunday in fishing and other harmless pursuits; these were now all put an
73 end to. The Sabbath became a season of dread to William: he was required
69 to drive the family to and from the church, a distance of four miles
68 either way; and while they attended to the salvation of their souls
70 within the building, he was compelled to attend to the horses without
67 it, standing by them during divine service under a burning sun, or
73 drizzling rain. Although William did not get the religion of his master,
65 he acquired a family passion which appears to have been strongly
65 intermixed with the devotional exercises of the household of Dr.
71 Young--a love of sweet julep. In the evening, the slaves were required
68 to attend family worship. Before commencing the service, it was the
70 custom to hand a pitcher of the favourite beverage to every member of
71 the family, not excepting the nephew, a child of between four and five
71 years old. William was in the habit of watching his opportunity during
72 the prayer and helping himself from the pitcher, but one day letting it
72 fall, his propensity for this intoxicating drink was discovered, and he
42 was severely punished for its indulgence.
1 
71 In 1830, being then about sixteen years of age, William was hired to a
72 slave-dealer named Walker. This change of employment led the youth away
71 south and frustrated, for a time, his plans for escape. His experience
67 while in this capacity furnishes some interesting, though painful,
67 details of the legalized traffic in human beings carried on in the
71 United States. The desperation to which the slaves are driven at their
73 forced separation from husband, wife, children, and kindred, he found to
68 be a frequent cause of suicide. Slave-dealers he discovered were as
69 great adepts at deception in the sale of their commodity as the most
69 knowing down-easter, or tricky horse dealer. William's occupation on
71 board the steamer, as they steamed south, was to prepare the stock for
71 the market, by shaving off whiskers and blacking the grey hairs with a
23 colouring composition.
1 
67 At the expiration of the period of his hiring with Walker, William
65 returned to his master rejoiced to have escaped an employment so
73 repugnant to his feelings. But this joy was not of long duration. One of
72 his sisters who, although sold to another master had been living in the
73 same city with himself and mother, was again sold to be sent away south,
68 never in all probability to meet her sorrowing relatives. Dr. Young
73 also, wanting money, intimated to his young kinsman that he was about to
70 sell him. This intimation determined William, in conjunction with his
63 mother, to attempt their escape. For ten nights they travelled
73 northwards, hiding themselves in the woods by day. The mother and son at
71 length deemed themselves safe from re-capture, and, although weary and
73 foot-sore, were laying down sanguine plans for the acquisition of a farm
71 in Canada, the purchase of the freedom of the six other members of the
71 family still in slavery, and rejoicing in the anticipated happiness of
67 their free home in Canada. At that moment three men made up to and
68 seized them, bound the son and led him, with his desponding mother,
71 back to slavery. Elizabeth was sold and sent away south, while her son
66 became the property of a merchant tailor named Willi. Mr. Brown's
70 description of the final interview between himself and his mother, is
70 one of the most touching portions of his narrative. The mother, after
72 expressing her conviction of the speedy escape from slavery by the hand
72 of death, enjoined her child to persevere in his endeavours to gain his
70 freedom by flight. Her blessing was interrupted by the kick and curse
57 bestowed by her dehumanized master upon her beloved son.
1 
63 After having been hired for a short time to the captain of the
71 steam-boat _Otto_, William was finally sold to Captain Enoch Price for
73 650 dollars. That the quickness and intelligence of William rendered him
69 very valuable as a slave, is favoured by the evidence of Enoch Price
72 himself, who states that he was offered 2000 dollars for Sanford (as he
67 was called), in New Orleans. William was strongly urged by his new
73 mistress to marry. To facilitate this object, she even went so far as to
70 purchase a girl for whom she fancied he had an affection. He himself,
68 however, had secretly resolved never to enter into such a connexion
68 while in slavery, knowing that marriage, in the true and honourable
69 sense of the term, could not exist among slaves. Notwithstanding the
71 multitude of petty offences for which a slave is severely punished, it
65 is singular that one crime--bigamy--is visited upon a white with
70 severity, while no slave has ever yet been tried for it. In fact, the
69 man is allowed to form connections with as many women, and the women
34 with as many men, as they please.
1 
70 At St. Louis, William was employed as coachman to Mr. Price; but when
72 that gentleman subsequently took his family up the river to Cincinnati,
67 Sanford acted as appointed steward. While lying off this city, the
71 long-looked-for opportunity of escape presented itself; and on the 1st
73 of January, 1834--he being then almost twenty years of age--succeeded in
73 getting from the steamer to the wharf, and thence to the woods, where he
66 lay concealed until the shades of night had set in, when he again
73 commenced his journey northwards. While with Dr. Young, a nephew of that
71 gentleman, whose christian name was William, came into the family: the
70 slave was, therefore, denuded of the name of William, and thenceforth
66 called Sanford. This deprivation of his original name he had ever
71 regarded as an indignity, and having now gained his freedom he resumed
73 his original name; and as there was no one by whom he could be addressed
72 by it, he exultingly enjoyed the first-fruits of his freedom by calling
73 himself aloud by his old name "William!" After passing through a variety
73 of painful vicissitudes, on the eighth day he found himself destitute of
73 pecuniary means, and unable, from severe illness, to pursue his journey.
73 In that condition he was discovered by a venerable member of the Society
71 of Friends, who placed him in a covered waggon and took him to his own
71 house. There he remained about fifteen days, and by the kind treatment
61 of his host and hostess, who were what in America are called
71 "Thompsonians," he was restored to health, and supplied with the means
70 of pursuing his journey. The name of this, his first kind benefactor,
72 was "Wells Brown." As William had risen from the degradation of a slave
68 to the dignity of a man, it was expedient that he should follow the
69 customs of other men, and adopt a second name. His venerable friend,
73 therefore, bestowed upon him his own name, which, prefixed by his former
70 designation, made him "William Wells Brown," a name that will live in
72 history, while those of the men who claimed him as property would, were
70 it not for his deeds, have been unknown beyond the town in which they
66 lived. In nine days from the time he left Wells Brown's house, he
68 arrived at Cleveland, in the State of Ohio, where he found he could
70 remain comparatively safe from the pursuit of the man-stealer. Having
68 obtained employment as a waiter, he remained in that city until the
71 following spring, when he procured an engagement on board a steam-boat
68 plying on Lake Erie. In that situation he was enabled, during seven
70 months, to assist no less than sixty-nine slaves to escape to Canada.
71 While a slave he had regarded the whites as the natural enemies of his
71 race. It was, therefore, with no small pleasure that he discovered the
71 existence of the salt of America, in the despised Abolitionists of the
72 Northern States. He read with assiduity the writings of Benjamin Lundy,
68 William Lloyd Garrison, and others; and after his own twenty years'
64 experience of slavery, it is not surprising that he should have
65 enthusiastically embraced the principles of "total and immediate
49 emancipation," and "no union with slaveholders."
1 
61 In proportion as his mind expanded under the more favourable
72 circumstances in which he was placed, he became anxious, not merely for
68 the redemption of his race from personal slavery, but for the moral
68 elevation of those among them who were free. Finding that habits of
70 intoxication were too prevalent amongst his coloured brethren, he, in
69 conjunction with others, commenced a temperance reformation in their
72 body. Such was the success of their efforts that in three years, in the
70 city of Buffalo alone, a society of upwards of 500 members was raised
67 out of a coloured population of 700. Of that society Mr. Brown was
26 thrice elected President.
1 
65 The intellectual powers of our author, coupled with his intimate
71 acquaintance with the workings of the slave system, recommended him to
71 the Abolitionists as a man eminently qualified to arouse the attention
66 of the people of the Northern States to the great national sin of
70 America. In 1843 he was engaged as a lecturer by the Western New-York
72 Anti-Slavery Society. From 1844 to 1847 he laboured in the anti-slavery
69 cause in connection with the American Anti-Slavery Society, and from
72 that period up to the time of his departure for Europe, in 1849, he was
73 an agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. The records of those
72 societies furnish abundant evidence of the success of his labours. From
71 the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society he early received the following
13 testimony:--
1 
67 "Since Mr. Brown became an agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery
59 Society, he has lectured in very many of the towns of this
70 Commonwealth, and won for himself general respect and approbation. He
70 combines true self-respect with true humility, and rare judiciousness
59 with great moral courage. Himself a fugitive slave, he can
70 experimentally describe the situation of those in bonds as bound with
71 them; and he powerfully illustrates the diabolism of that system which
65 keeps in chains and darkness a host of minds, which, if free and
63 enlightened, would shine among men like stars in a firmament."
1 
72 Another member of that Society speaks thus of him:--"I need not attempt
70 any description of the ability and efficiency which characterized his
69 speaking throughout the meetings. To you who know him so well, it is
71 enough to say that his lectures were worthy of himself. He has left an
71 impression on the minds of the people, that few could have done. Cold,
70 indeed, must be the heart that could resist the appeals of so noble a
65 specimen of humanity, in behalf of a crushed and despised race."
1 
72 Notwithstanding the celebrity Mr. Brown had acquired in the north, as a
73 man of genius and talent, and the general respect his high character had
67 gained him, the slave spirit of America denied him the rights of a
71 citizen. By the constitution of the United States, he was every moment
73 liable to be seized and sent back to slavery. He was in daily peril of a
66 gradual legalized murder, under a system one of whose established
72 economical principles is, that it is more profitable to work up a slave
69 on a plantation in a short time, by excessive labour and cheap food,
69 than to obtain a lengthened remuneration by moderate work and humane
71 treatment. His only protection from such a fate was the anomaly of the
65 ascendancy of the public opinion over the law of the country. So
69 uncertain, however, was that tenure of liberty, that even before the
73 passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, it was deemed expedient to secure the
73 services of Frederick Douglass to the anti-slavery cause by the purchase
68 of his freedom. The same course might have been taken to secure the
73 labours of Mr. Brown, had he not entertained an unconquerable repugnance
72 to its adoption. On the 10th of January, 1848, Enoch Price wrote to Mr.
71 Edmund Quincy offering to sell Mr. Brown to himself or friends for 325
73 dollars. To this communication the fugitive returned the following pithy
19 and noble reply:--
1 
71 "I cannot accept of Mr. Price's offer to become a purchaser of my body
73 and soul. God made me as free as he did Enoch Price, and Mr. Price shall
63 never receive a dollar from me or my friends with my consent."
1 
73 There were, however, other reasons besides his personal safety which led
72 to Mr. Brown's visit to Europe. It was thought desirable always to have
73 in England some talented man of colour who should be a living lie to the
69 doctrine of the inferiority of the African race: and it was moreover
67 felt that none could so powerfully advocate the cause of "those in
69 bonds" as one who had actually been "bound with them." This had been
64 proved in the extraordinary effect produced in Great Britain by
63 Frederick Douglass in 1845 and 1846. The American Committee in
68 connection with the Peace Congress were also desirous of sending to
68 Europe coloured representatives of their Society, and Mr. Brown was
68 selected for that purpose, and duly accredited by them to the Paris
10 Congress.
1 
71 On the 18th of July, 1849, a large meeting of the coloured citizens of
72 Boston was held in Washington Hall to bid him farewell. At that meeting
54 the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:--
1 
73 "_Resolved_,--That we bid our brother, William Wells Brown, God speed in
68       his mission to Europe, and commend him to the hospitality and
53       encouragement of all true friends of humanity.
1 
69 "_Resolved_,--That we forward by him our renewed protest against the
73       American Colonization Society; and invoke for him a candid hearing
73       before the British public, in reply to the efforts put forth there
67       by the Rev. Mr. Miller, or any other agent of said Society."
1 
73 Two days afterwards he sailed for Europe, encountering on his voyage his
54 last experience of American prejudice against colour.
1 
73 On the 28th of August he landed at Liverpool, a time and place memorable
71 in his life as the first upon which he could truly call himself a free
68 man upon God's earth. In the history of nations, as of individuals,
65 there is often singular retributive mercy as well as retributive
71 justice. In the seventeenth century the victims of monarchical tyranny
71 in Great Britain found social and political freedom when they set foot
73 upon Plymouth Rock in New England: in the nineteenth century the victims
68 of the oppressions of the American Republic find freedom and social
66 equality upon the shores of monarchical England. Liverpool, which
69 seventy years back was so steeped in the guilt of negro slavery that
72 Paine expressed his surprise that God did not sweep it from the face of
72 the earth, is now to the hunted negro the Plymouth Rock of Old England.
70 From Liverpool he proceeded to Dublin where he was warmly received by
69 Mr. Haughton, Mr. Webb, and other friends of the slave, and publicly
72 welcomed at a large meeting presided over by the first named gentleman.
1 
67 The reception of Mr. Brown at the Peace Congress in Paris was most
71 flattering. In a company, comprising a large portion of the _elite_ of
72 Europe, he admirably maintained his reputation as a public speaker. His
71 brief address, upon that "war spirit of America which holds in bondage
70 three million of his brethren," produced a profound sensation. At its
67 conclusion the speaker was warmly greeted by Victor Hugo, the Abbe
70 Duguerry, Emile de Girardin, the Pastor Coquerel, Richard Cobden, and
64 every man of note in the Assembly. At the soiree given by M. De
73 Tocqueville, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the other fetes given
67 to the Members of the Congress, Mr. Brown was received with marked
11 attention.
1 
61 Having finished his Peace mission in France, he commenced an
69 Anti-slavery tour in England and Scotland. With that independence of
69 feeling which those who are acquainted with him know to be his chief
67 characteristic, he rejected the idea of anything like eleemosynary
65 support. He determined to maintain himself and family by his own
71 exertions--by his literary labours, and the honourable profession of a
70 public lecturer. His first metropolitan reception in England was at a
70 large, influential, and enthusiastic meeting in the Music Hall, Stone
70 Street. The members of the Whittington Club--an institution numbering
66 nearly 2000 members, among whom are Lords Brougham, Dudley Coutts
64 Stuart, and Beaumont; Charles Dickens, Douglass Jerrold, Martin
72 Thackeray, Charles Lushington, M.P., Monckton Milnes, M.P., and several
71 other of the most distinguished legislators and literary men and women
72 in this country--elected Mr. Brown an honorary member of the Club, as a
73 mark of respect to his character; and, as the following extract from the
63 Secretary, Mr. Stundwicke, will show, as a protest against the
62 distinctions made between man and man on account of colour in
71 America:--"I have much pleasure in conveying to you the best thanks of
73 the managing committee of this institution for the excellent lecture you
72 gave here last evening on the subject of 'Slavery in America,' and also
68 in presenting you in their names with an honorary membership of the
71 Club. It is hoped that you will often avail yourself of its privileges
71 by coming amongst us. You will then see, by the cordial welcome of the
72 members, that they protest against the odious distinctions made between
67 man and man, and the abominable traffic of which you have been the
9 victim."
1 
68 For the last three years Mr. Brown has been engaged in visiting and
71 holding meetings in nearly all the large towns in the kingdom upon the
73 question of American Slavery, Temperance, and other subjects. Perhaps no
69 coloured individual, not excepting that extraordinary man, Frederick
73 Douglass, has done more good in disseminating anti-slavery principles in
32 England, Scotland, and Ireland.
1 
73 In the spring of 1851, two most interesting fugitives, William and Ellen
70 Craft, arrived in England. They had made their escape from the South,
70 the wife disguised in male attire, and the husband in the capacity of
73 her slave. William Craft was doing a thriving business in Boston, but in
69 1851 was driven with his wife from that city by the operation of the
70 Fugitive Slave Law. For several months they travelled in company with
72 Mr. Brown in this country, deepening the disgust created by Mr. Brown's
73 eloquent denunciation of slavery by their simple but touching narrative.
69 At length they were enabled to gratify their thirst for education by
73 gaining admission to Lady Byron's school at Oakham, Surrey. In the month
66 of May, Mr. Brown and Mr. and Mrs. Craft were taken by a party of
71 anti-slavery friends to the Great Exhibition. The honourable manner in
72 which they were received by distinguished persons to whom their history
69 was known, and the freedom with which they perambulated the American
72 department, was a salutary rebuke to the numerous Americans present, in
65 regard to the great sin of their country--slavery; and its great
71 folly--prejudice of colour. A curious circumstance occurred during the
73 Exhibition. Among the hosts of American visitors to this country was Mr.
70 Brown's late master, Enoch Price, who made diligent inquiry after his
61 lost piece of property--not, of course, with any view to its
73 reclamation--but, to the mutual regret of both parties, without success.
73 It is gratifying to state that the master spoke highly of, and expressed
70 a wish for the future prosperity of, his fugitive slave; a fact which
68 tends to prove that prejudice of colour is to a very great extent a
71 thing of locality and association. Had Mr. Price, however, left behind
72 him letters of manumission for Mr. Brown, enabling him, if he chose, to
73 return to his native land, he would have given a more practical proof of
67 respect, and of the sincerity of his desire for the welfare of Mr.
7 Brown.
1 
66 It would extend these pages far beyond their proposed length were
72 anything like a detailed account of Mr. Brown's anti-slavery labours in
63 this country to be attempted. Suffice it to say that they have
68 everywhere been attended with benefit and approbation. At Bolton an
69 admirable address from the ladies was presented to him, and at other
53 places he has received most honourable testimonials.
1 
70 Since Mr. Brown left America, the condition of the fugitive slaves in
70 his own country has, through the operation of the Fugitive Slave Law,
67 been rendered so perilous as to preclude the possibility of return
66 without the almost certain loss of liberty. His expatriation has,
72 however, been a gain to the cause of humanity in this country, where an
66 intelligent representative of the oppressed coloured Americans is
63 constantly needed, not only to describe, in language of fervid
72 eloquence, the wrongs inflicted upon his race in the United States, but
69 to prevent their bonds being strengthened in this country by holding
73 fellowship with slave-holding and slave-abetting ministers from America.
68 In his lectures he has clearly demonstrated the fact, that the sole
66 support of the slavery of the United States is its churches. This
72 knowledge of the standing of American ministers in reference to slavery
69 has, in the case of Dr. Dyer, and in many other instances, been most
68 serviceable, preventing their reception into communion with British
72 churches. Last year Mr. Brown succeeded in getting over to this country
69 his daughters, two interesting girls twelve and sixteen years of age
73 respectively, who are now receiving an education which will qualify them
71 hereafter to become teachers in their turn--a description of education
68 which would have been denied them in their native land. In 1834 Mr.
72 Brown married a free coloured woman, who died in January of the present
6 year.
1 
72 The condition of escaped slaves has engaged much of his attention while
71 in this country. He found that in England no anti-slavery organization
64 existed whose object was to aid fugitive slaves in obtaining an
70 honourable subsistence in the land of their exile. In most cases they
73 are thrown upon the support of a few warm-hearted anti-slavery advocates
68 in this country, pre-eminent among whom stands Mr. Brown's earliest
71 friend, Mr. George Thompson, M.P., whose house is rarely free from one
68 or more of those who have acquired the designation of his "American
69 constituents." This want has recently been attempted to be supplied,
73 partly through Mr. Brown's exertions, and partly by the establishment of
45 the Anglo-American Anti-Slavery Association.
1 
70 On the 1st of August, 1851, a meeting of the most novel character was
71 held at the Hall of Commerce, London, being a soiree given by fugitive
70 slaves in this country to Mr. George Thompson, on his return from his
69 American mission on behalf of their race. That meeting was most ably
71 presided over by Mr. Brown, and the speeches made upon the occasion by
73 fugitive slaves were of the most interesting and creditable description.
70 Although a residence in Canada is infinitely preferable to slavery in
63 America, yet the climate of that country is uncongenial to the
72 constitutions of the fugitive slaves, and their lack of education is an
73 almost insuperable barrier to their social progress. The latter evil Mr.
73 Brown attempted to remedy by the establishment of a Manual Labour School
11 in Canada.
1 
65 A public meeting, attended by between 3000 and 4000 persons, was
70 convened by Mr. Brown, on the 6th of January, 1851, in the City Hall,
73 Glasgow, presided over by Mr. Hastie, one of the representatives of that
72 city, at which meeting a resolution was unanimously passed approving of
73 Mr. Brown's scheme, which scheme, however, never received that amount of
72 support which would have enabled him to bring it into practice; and the
70 plan at present only remains as an evidence of its author's ingenuity
62 and desire for the elevation of his depressed race. Mr. Brown
67 subsequently made, through the columns of the _Times_ newspaper, a
71 proposition for the emigration of American fugitive slaves, under fair
73 and honourable terms, to the West Indies, where there is a great lack of
67 that tillage labour which they are so capable of undertaking. This
71 proposition has hitherto met with no better fate than its predecessor.
1 
64 Mr. Brown's literary abilities may be partly judged of from the
71 following pages. The amount of knowledge and education he has acquired
70 under circumstances of no ordinary difficulty, is a striking proof of
71 what can be done by combined genius and industry. His proficiency as a
73 linguist, without the aid of a master, is considerable. His present work
70 is a valuable addition to the stock of English literature. The honour
68 which has hitherto been paid, and which, so long as he resides upon
69 British soil, will no doubt continue to be paid to his character and
71 talents, must have its influence in abating the senseless prejudice of
65 colour in America, and hastening the time when the object of his
70 mission, the abolition of the slavery of his native country, shall be
68 accomplished, and that young Republic renouncing with penitence its
65 national sin, shall take its proper place amongst the most free,
47 civilized, and Christian nations of the earth.

9 PREFACE.
1 
1 
71 While I feel conscious that most of the contents of these Letters will
72 be interesting chiefly to American readers, yet I may indulge the hope,
71 that the fact of their being the first production of a Fugitive Slave,
70 as a history of travels, may carry with them novelty enough to secure
71 for them, to some extent, the attention of the reading public of Great
71 Britain. Most of the letters were written for the private perusal of a
69 few personal friends in America; some were contributed to "Frederick
66 Douglass's paper," a journal published in the United States. In a
69 printed circular sent some weeks since to some of my friends, asking
72 subscriptions to this volume, I stated the reasons for its publication:
69 these need not be repeated here. To those who so promptly and kindly
73 responded to that appeal, I tender my most sincere thanks. It is with no
71 little diffidence that I lay these letters before the public; for I am
72 not blind to the fact, that they must contain many errors; and to those
71 who shall find fault with them on that account, it may not be too much
70 for me to ask them kindly to remember, that the author was a slave in
72 one of the Southern States of America, until he had attained the age of
69 twenty years; and that the education he has acquired, was by his own
62 exertions, he never having had a day's schooling in his life.

68 _Departure from Boston--the Passengers--Halifax--the Passage--First
27 Sight of Land--Liverpool._
1 
1 
42                     LIVERPOOL, _July 28_.
1 
67 On the 18th July, 1849, I took passage in the steam-ship _Canada_,
70 Captain Judkins, bound for Liverpool. The day was a warm one; so much
72 so, that many persons on board, as well as several on shore, stood with
71 their umbrellas up, so intense was the heat of the sun. The ringing of
69 the ship's bell was a signal for us to shake hands with our friends,
67 which we did, and then stepped on the deck of the noble craft. The
71 _Canada_ quitted her moorings at half-past twelve, and we were soon in
69 motion. As we were passing out of Boston Bay, I took my stand on the
67 quarter-deck, to take a last farewell (at least for a time), of my
72 native land. A visit to the old world, up to that time had seemed but a
69 dream. As I looked back upon the receding land, recollections of the
73 past rushed through my mind in quick succession. From the treatment that
66 I had received from the Americans as a victim of slavery, and the
72 knowledge that I was at that time liable to be seized and again reduced
67 to whips and chains, I had supposed that I would leave the country
72 without any regret; but in this I was mistaken, for when I saw the last
69 thread of communication cut off between me and the land, and the dim
72 shores dying away in the distance, I almost regretted that I was not on
7 shore.
1 
71 An anticipated trip to a foreign country appears pleasant when talking
71 about it, especially when surrounded by friends whom we love; but when
73 we have left them all behind, it does not seem so pleasant. Whatever may
70 be the fault of the government under which we live, and no matter how
70 oppressive her laws may appear, yet we leave our native land (if such
72 it be) with feelings akin to sorrow. With the steamer's powerful engine
68 at work, and with a fair wind, we were speedily on the bosom of the
67 Atlantic, which was as calm and as smooth as our own Hudson in its
71 calmest aspect. We had on board above one hundred passengers, forty of
70 whom were the "Viennese children"--a troop of dancers. The passengers
67 represented several different nations, English, French, Spaniards,
71 Africans, and Americans. One man who had the longest pair of mustaches
65 that mortal man was ever doomed to wear, especially attracted my
70 attention. He appeared to belong to no country in particular, but was
67 yet the busiest man on board. After viewing for some time the many
67 strange faces around me, I descended to the cabin to look after my
73 luggage, which had been put hurriedly on board. I hope that all who take
69 a trip of so great a distance may be as fortunate as I was, in being
71 supplied with books to read on the voyage. My friends had furnished me
73 with literature, from "Macaulay's History of England" to "Jane Eyre," so
49 that I did not want for books to occupy my time.
1 
72 A pleasant passage of about thirty hours, brought us to Halifax, at six
71 o'clock in the evening. In company with my friend the President of the
67 Oberlin Institute, I took a stroll through the town; and from what
72 little I saw of the people in the streets, I am sure that the taking of
71 the Temperance pledge would do them no injury. Our stay at Halifax was
70 short. Having taken in a few sacks of coals, the mails, and a limited
66 number of passengers, we were again out, and soon at sea. After a
71 pleasant run of seven days more, and as I was lying in my bed, I heard
72 the cry of "Land a-head." Although our passage had been unprecedentedly
71 short, yet I need not inform you that this news was hailed with joy by
73 all on board. For my own part, I was soon on deck. Away in the distance,
69 and on our larboard quarter, were the grey hills of Ireland. Yes! we
73 were in sight of the land of Emmett and O'Connell. While I rejoiced with
72 the other passengers at the sight of land, and the near approach to the
70 end of the voyage, I felt low spirited, because it reminded me of the
67 great distance I was from home. But the experience of above twenty
73 years' travelling, had prepared me to undergo what most persons must lay
73 their account with, in visiting a strange country. This was the last day
69 but one that we were to be on board; and as if moved by the sight of
56 land, all seemed to be gathering their different things
71 together--brushing up their old clothes and putting on their new ones,
68 as if this would bring them any sooner to the end of their journey.
1 
71 The last night on board was the most pleasant, apparently, that we had
68 experienced; probably, because it was the last. The moon was in her
69 meridian splendour, pouring her broad light over the calm sea; while
72 near to us, on our starboard side, was a ship with her snow-white sails
72 spread aloft, and stealing through the water like a thing of life. What
66 can present a more picturesque view, than two vessels at sea on a
68 moonlight night, and within a few rods of each other? With a gentle
71 breeze, and the powerful engine at work, we seemed to be flying to the
35 embrace of our British neighbours.
1 
72 The next morning I was up before the sun, and found that we were within
67 a few miles of Liverpool. The taking of a pilot on board at eleven
70 o'clock, warned us to prepare to quit our ocean palace and seek other
71 quarters. At a little past three o'clock, the ship cast anchor, and we
70 were all tumbled, bag and baggage, into a small steamer, and in a few
72 moments were at the door of the Custom-House. The passage had only been
73 nine days and twenty-two hours, the quickest on record at that time, yet
67 it was long enough. I waited nearly three hours before my name was
70 called, and when it was, I unlocked my trunks and handed them over to
71 one of the officers, whose dirty hands made no improvement on the work
69 of the laundress. First one article was taken out, and then another,
72 till an _Iron Collar_ that had been worn by a female slave on the banks
70 of the Mississippi, was hauled out, and this democratic instrument of
69 torture became the centre of attraction; so much so, that instead of
71 going on with the examination, all hands stopped to look at the "Negro
9 Collar."
1 
65 Several of my countrymen who were standing by, were not a little
66 displeased at answers which I gave to questions on the subject of
64 Slavery; but they held their peace. The interest created by the
72 appearance of the Iron Collar, closed the examination of my luggage. As
68 if afraid that they would find something more hideous, they put the
69 Custom-House mark on each piece, and passed them out, and I was soon
67 comfortably installed at Brown's Temperance Hotel, Clayton Square.
1 
1 
71 No person of my complexion can visit this country without being struck
70 with the marked difference between the English and the Americans. The
68 prejudice which I have experienced on all and every occasion in the
69 United States, and to some extent on board the _Canada_, vanished as
72 soon as I set foot on the soil of Britain. In America I had been bought
67 and sold as a slave, in the Southern States. In the so-called free
61 States, I had been treated as one born to occupy an inferior
66 position,--in steamers, compelled to take my fare on the deck; in
68 hotels, to take my meals in the kitchen; in coaches, to ride on the
70 outside; in railways, to ride in the "negro car;" and in churches, to
72 sit in the "negro pew." But no sooner was I on British soil, than I was
64 recognised as a man, and an equal. The very dogs in the streets
70 appeared conscious of my manhood. Such is the difference, and such is
71 the change that is brought about by a trip of nine days in an Atlantic
9 steamer.
1 
70 I was not more struck with the treatment of the people, than with the
73 appearance of the great seaport of the world. The grey appearance of the
72 stone piers and docks, the dark look of the magnificent warehouses, the
66 substantial appearance of every thing around, causes one to think
68 himself in a new world instead of the old. Every thing in Liverpool
73 looks old, yet nothing is worn out. The beautiful villas on the opposite
68 side of the river, in the vicinity of Birkenhead, together with the
73 countless number of vessels in the river, and the great ships to be seen
59 in the stream, give life and animation to the whole scene.
1 
71 Every thing in and about Liverpool seems to be built for the future as
66 well as the present. We had time to examine but few of the public
68 buildings, the first of which was the Custom-House, an edifice that
47 would be an ornament to any city in the world.
1 
67 For the first time in my life, I can say "I am truly free." My old
73 master may make his appearance here, with the Constitution of the United
72 States in his pocket, the Fugitive Slave Law in one hand and the chains
67 in the other, and claim me as his property, but all will avail him
72 nothing. I can here stand and look the tyrant in the face, and tell him
72 that I am his equal! England is, indeed, the "land of the free, and the
20 home of the brave."

53 City--the Birth-Place of Thomas Moore--a Reception._
1 
1 
40                     DUBLIN, _August 6_.
1 
68 After remaining in Liverpool two days, I took passage in the little
70 steamer _Adelaide_ for this city. The wind being high on the night of
69 our voyage, the vessel had scarcely got to sea ere we were driven to
71 our berths; and though the distance from Liverpool to Dublin is short,
72 yet, strange to say, I witnessed more effects of the sea and rolling of
73 the steamer upon the passengers, than was to be seen during the whole of
72 our voyage from America. We reached Kingstown, five miles below Dublin,
72 after a passage of nearly fifteen hours, and were soon seated on a car,
71 and on our way to the city. While coming into the bay, one gets a fine
71 view of Dublin and the surrounding country. Few sheets of water make a
68 more beautiful appearance than Dublin Bay. We found it as still and
72 smooth as a mirror, with a soft mist on its surface--a strange contrast
56 to the boisterous sea that we had left a moment before.
1 
72 The curious phrases of the Irish sounded harshly upon my ear, probably,
72 because they were strange to me. I lost no time on reaching the city in
73 seeking out some to whom I had letters of introduction, one of whom gave
73 me an invitation to make his house my home during my stay, an invitation
38 which I did not think fit to decline.
1 
66 Dublin, the Metropolis of Ireland, is a city of above two hundred
71 thousand inhabitants, and is considered by the people of Ireland to be
68 the second city in the British Empire. The Liffey, which falls into
70 Dublin Bay a little below the Custom-House, divides the town into two
73 nearly equal parts. The streets are--some of them--very fine, especially
71 upper Sackville Street, in the centre of which stands a pillar erected
69 to Nelson, England's most distinguished Naval Commander. The Bank of
66 Ireland, to which I paid a visit, is a splendid building, and was
71 formerly the Parliament House. This magnificent edifice fronts College
72 Green, and near at hand stands a bronze statue of William III. The Bank
72 and the Custom-House are two of the finest monuments of architecture in
68 the city; the latter of which stands near the river Liffey, and its
67 front makes an imposing appearance, extending to three hundred and
72 seventy-five feet. It is built of Portland stone, and is adorned with a
66 beautiful portico in the centre, consisting of four Doric columns
73 supporting an enriched entablature, decorated with a group of figures in
72 alto-relievo, representing Hibernia and Britannia presenting emblems of
69 peace and liberty. A magnificent dome, supporting a cupola, on whose
70 apex stands a colossal figure of Hope, rises nobly from the centre of
69 the building to a height of one hundred and twenty-five feet. It is,
44 withal, a fine specimen of what man can do.
1 
72 From this noble edifice, we bent our steps to another part of the city,
72 and soon found ourselves in the vicinity of St. Patrick's, where we had
73 a heart-sickening view of the poorest of the poor. All the recollections
70 of poverty which I had ever beheld, seemed to disappear in comparison
73 with what was then before me. We passed a filthy and noisy market, where
73 fruit and vegetable women were screaming and begging those passing by to
69 purchase their commodities; while in and about the market-place were
71 throngs of beggars fighting for rotten fruit, cabbage stocks, and even
72 the very trimmings of vegetables. On the side walks, were great numbers
71 hovering about the doors of the more wealthy, and following strangers,
72 importuning them for "pence to buy bread." Sickly and emaciated-looking
70 creatures, half naked, were at our heels at every turn. After passing
72 through a half dozen, or more, of narrow and dirty streets, we returned
72 to our lodgings, impressed with the idea that we had seen enough of the
18 poor for one day.
1 
71 In our return home, we passed through a respectable looking street, in
72 which stands a small three storey brick building, which was pointed out
72 to us as the birth-place of Thomas Moore, the poet. The following verse
72 from one of Moore's poems was continually in my mind while viewing this
9 house:--
1 
35     "Where is the slave, so lowly,
32     Condemn'd to chains unholy,
24     Who, could he burst
24     His bonds at first,
37     Would pine beneath them slowly?"
1 
41        *       *       *       *       *
1 
71 Yesterday was the Sabbath, but it had more the appearance of a holiday
73 than a day of rest. It had been announced the day before, that the Royal
68 fleet was expected, and at an early hour on Sunday, the entire town
72 seemed to be on the move towards Kingstown, and as the family with whom
67 I was staying followed the multitude, I was not inclined to remain
67 behind, and so went with them. On reaching the station we found it
72 utterly impossible to get standing room in any of the trains, much less
72 a seat, and therefore determined to reach Kingstown under the plea of a
70 morning's walk; and in this we were not alone, for during the walk of
67 five miles the road was filled with thousands of pedestrians and a
71 countless number of carriages, phaetons, and vehicles of a more humble
7 order.
1 
65 We reached the lower town in time to get a good dinner, and rest
73 ourselves before going to make further searches for Her Majesty's fleet.
71 At a little past four o'clock, we observed the multitude going towards
68 the pier, a number of whom were yelling at the top of their voices,
70 "It's coming, it's coming;" but on going to the quay, we found that a
71 false alarm had been given. However, we had been on the look-out but a
69 short time, when a column of smoke rising as it were out of the sea,
70 announced that the Royal fleet was near at hand. The concourse in the
67 vicinity of the pier was variously estimated at from eighty to one
18 hundred thousand.
1 
72 It was not long before the five steamers were entering the harbour, the
72 one bearing Her Majesty leading the way. As each vessel had a number of
71 distinguished persons on board, the people appeared to be at a loss to
71 know which was the Queen; and as each party made its appearance on the
68 promenade deck, they were received with great enthusiasm, the party
72 having the best looking lady being received with the greatest applause.
69 The Prince of Wales, and Prince Alfred, while crossing the deck were
72 recognised and greeted with three cheers; the former taking off his hat
68 and bowing to the people, showed that he had had some training as a
73 public man although not ten years of age. But not so with Prince Alfred;
70 for, when his brother turned to him and asked him to take off his hat
73 and make a bow to the people, he shook his head and said, "No." This was
73 received with hearty laughter by those on board, and was responded to by
70 the thousands on shore. But greater applause was yet in store for the
71 young prince; for the captain of the steamer being near by, and seeing
70 that the Prince of Wales could not prevail on his brother to take off
71 his hat, stepped up to him and undertook to take it off for him, when,
71 seemingly to the delight of all, the prince put both hands to his head
73 and held his hat fast. This was regarded as a sign of courage and future
72 renown, and was received with the greatest enthusiasm--many crying out,
60 "Good, good: he will make a brave king when his day comes."
1 
65 After the greetings and applause had been wasted on many who had
70 appeared on deck, all at once, as if by some magic power, we beheld a
72 lady rather small in stature, with auburn or reddish hair, attired in a
69 plain dress, and wearing a sky-blue bonnet, standing on the larboard
72 paddle-box, by the side of a tall good-looking man, with mustaches. The
73 thunders of applause that now rent the air, and cries of "The Queen, the
73 Queen," seemed to set at rest the question of which was Her Majesty. But
70 a few moments were allowed to the people to look at the Queen, before
72 she again disappeared; and it was understood that she would not be seen
71 again that evening. A rush was then made for the railway, to return to
8 Dublin.

1 
70 Yesterday was a great day in Dublin. At an early hour the bells began
66 their merry peals, and the people were soon seen in groups in the
73 streets and public squares. The hour of ten was fixed for the procession
73 to leave Kingstown, and it was expected to enter the city at eleven. The
71 windows of the houses in the streets through which the Royal train was
64 to pass, were at a premium, and seemed to find ready occupants.
1 
67 Being invited the day previous to occupy part of a window in Upper
68 Sackville Street, I was stationed at my allotted place, at an early
72 hour, with an out-stretched neck and open eyes. My own colour differing
71 from those about me, I attracted not a little attention from many; and
73 often, when gazing down the street to see if the Royal procession was in
70 sight, would find myself eyed by all around. But neither while at the
71 window, or in the streets, was I once insulted. This was so unlike the
69 American prejudice, that it seemed strange to me. It was near twelve
72 o'clock before the procession entered Sackville Street, and when it did
72 all eyes seemed to beam with delight. The first carriage contained only
72 Her Majesty and the Prince Consort; the second, the Royal children; and
70 the third, the Lords in Waiting. Fifteen carriages were used by those
73 that made up the Royal party. I had a full view of the Queen and all who
69 followed in the train. Her Majesty--whether from actual love for her
71 person, or the novelty of the occasion, I know not which--was received
73 everywhere with the greatest enthusiasm. One thing, however, is certain,
56 and that is--Queen Victoria is beloved by her subjects.
1 
70 But the grand _fete_ was reserved for the evening. Great preparations
70 had been made to have a grand illumination on the occasion, and hints
73 were thrown out that it would surpass anything ever witnessed in London.
68 In this they were not far out of the way; for all who witnessed the
71 scene admitted that it could scarcely have been surpassed. My own idea
71 of an illumination, as I had seen it in the backwoods of my own native
72 land, dwindled into nothing when compared with this magnificent affair.
1 
71 In company with a few friends, and a lady under my charge, I undertook
68 to pass through Sackville and one or two other streets, about eight
71 o'clock in the evening, but we found it utterly impossible to proceed.
66 Masses thronged the streets, and the wildest enthusiasm seemed to
72 prevail. In our attempt to cross the bridge, we were wedged in and lost
71 our companions; and on one occasion I was separated from the lady, and
73 took shelter under a cart standing in the street. After being jammed and
70 pulled about for nearly two hours, I returned to my lodgings, where I
71 found part of my company, who had come in one after another. At eleven
63 o'clock we had all assembled, and each told his adventures and
62 "hairbreadth escapes;" and nearly every one had lost a pocket
69 handkerchief or something of the kind: my own was among the missing.
71 However, I lost nothing; for a benevolent lady, who happened to be one
71 of the company, presented me with one which was of far more value than
20 the one I had lost.
1 
66 Every one appeared to enjoy the holiday which the Royal visit had
68 caused. But the Irish are indeed a strange people. How varied their
71 aspect--how contradictory their character. Ireland, the land of genius
68 and degradation--of great resources and unparalleled poverty--noble
70 deeds and the most revolting crimes--the land of distinguished poets,
73 splendid orators, and the bravest of soldiers--the land of ignorance and
65 beggary! Dublin is a splendid city, but its splendour is that of
64 chiselled marble rather than real life. One cannot behold these
71 architectural monuments without thinking of the great men that Ireland
71 has produced. The names of Burke, Sheridan, Flood, Grattan, O'Connell,
72 and Shiel, have become as familiar to the Americans as household words.
70 Burke is known as the statesman; Sheridan for his great speech on the
70 trial of Warren Hastings; Grattan for his eloquence; O'Connell as the
48 agitator; and Shiel as the accomplished orator.
1 
72 But of Ireland's sons, none stands higher in America than Thomas Moore,
69 the Poet. The vigour of his sarcasm, the glow of his enthusiasm, the
70 coruscations of his fancy, and the flashing of his wit, seem to be as
71 well understood in the new world as the old; and the support which his
67 pen has given to civil and religious liberty throughout the world,
57 entitled the Minstrel of Erin to this elevated position.
1 
70 Before leaving America I had heard much of the friends of my enslaved
68 countrymen residing in Ireland; and the reception I met with on all
71 hands while in public, satisfied me that what I had heard had not been
71 exaggerated. To the Webbs, Allens, and Haughtons, of Dublin, the cause
40 of the American slave is much indebted.
1 
64 I quitted Dublin with a feeling akin to leaving my native land.

66 Congress: first day--Church of the Madeleine--Column Vendome--the
9 French._
1 
1 
40                     PARIS, _August 23_.
1 
70 After a pleasant sojourn of three weeks in Ireland, I took passage in
71 one of the mail steamers for Liverpool, and arriving there was soon on
72 the road to the metropolis. The passage from Dublin to Liverpool was an
72 agreeable one. The rough sea that we passed through on going to Ireland
72 had given way to a dead calm, and our noble little steamer, on quitting
71 the Dublin wharf, seemed to understand that she was to have it all her
73 own way. During the first part of the evening, the boat appeared to feel
70 her importance, and, darting through the water with majestic strides,
70 she left behind her a dark cloud of smoke suspended in the air like a
71 banner; while, far astern in the wake of the vessel, could be seen the
69 rippled waves sparkling in the rays of the moon, giving strength and
40 beauty to the splendour of the evening.
1 
71 On reaching Liverpool, and partaking of a good breakfast, for which we
70 paid double price, we proceeded to the railway station, and were soon
68 going at a rate unknown to those accustomed to travel on one of our
73 American railways. At a little past two o'clock in the afternoon, we saw
73 in the distance the out-skirts of London. We could get but an indistinct
72 view, which had the appearance of one architectural mass, extending all
71 round to the horizon, and enveloped in a combination of fog and smoke;
70 and towering above every other object to be seen, was the dome of St.
18 Paul's Cathedral.
1 
70 A few moments more, and we were safely seated in a "Hansom's Patent,"
70 and on our way to Hughes's--one of the politest men of the George Fox
72 stamp we have ever met. Here we found forty or fifty persons, who, like
72 ourselves, were bound for the Peace Congress. The Sturges, the Wighams,
73 the Richardsons, the Allens, the Thomases, and a host of others not less
71 distinguished as friends of peace, were of the company--many of whom I
72 had heard of, but none of whom I had ever seen; yet I was not an entire
69 stranger to many, especially to the abolitionists. In company with a
66 friend, I sallied forth after tea to take a view of the city. The
71 evening was fine--the dense fog and smoke having to some extent passed
68 away, left the stars shining brightly, while the gas light from the
70 street lamps and the brilliant shop windows gave it the appearance of
71 day-light in a new form. "What street is this?" we asked. "Cheapside,"
68 was the reply. The street was thronged, and every body seemed to be
70 going at a rapid rate, as if there was something of importance at the
70 end of the journey. Flying vehicles of every description passing each
71 other with a dangerous rapidity, men with lovely women at their sides,
69 children running about as if they had lost their parents--all gave a
70 brilliancy to the scene scarcely to be excelled. If one wished to get
73 jammed and pushed about, he need go no farther than Cheapside. But every
69 thing of the kind is done with a degree of propriety in London, that
72 would put the New Yorkers to blush. If you are run over in London, they
70 "beg your pardon;" if they run over you in New York, you are "laughed
73 at:" in London, if your hat is knocked off it is picked up and handed to
71 you; if, in New York, you must pick it up yourself. There is a lack of
69 good manners among Americans that is scarcely known or understood in
72 Europe. Our stay in the great metropolis gave us but little opportunity
72 of seeing much of the place; for in twenty-four hours after our arrival
69 we joined the rest of the delegates, and started on our visit to our
19 Gallic neighbours.
1 
73 We assembled at the London Bridge Railway Station on Tuesday morning the
71 21st, a few minutes past nine, to the number of 600. The day was fine,
69 and every eye seemed to glow with enthusiasm. Besides the delegates,
68 there were probably not less than 600 more, who had come to see the
72 company start. We took our seats and appeared to be waiting for nothing
69 but the iron-horse to be fastened to the train, when all at once, we
67 were informed that we must go to the booking-office and change our
72 tickets. At this news every one appeared to be vexed. This caused great
71 trouble; for on returning to the train many persons got into the wrong
72 carriages; and several parties were separated from their friends, while
68 not a few were calling out at the top of their voices, "Where is my
69 wife? Where is my husband? Where is my luggage? Who's got my boy? Is
69 this the right train?" "What is that lady going to do with all these
69 children?" asked the guard. "Is she a delegate: are all the children
60 delegates?" In the carriage where I had taken my seat was a
73 good-looking lady who gave signs of being very much annoyed. "It is just
73 so when I am going anywhere: I never saw the like in my life," said she.
37 "I really wish I was at home again."
1 
71 An hour had now elapsed, and we were still at the station. However, we
69 were soon on our way, and going at express speed. In passing through
71 Kent we enjoyed the scenery exceedingly, as the weather was altogether
70 in our favour; and the drapery which nature hung on the trees, in the
71 part through which we passed, was in all its gaiety. On our arrival at
71 Folkstone, we found three steamers in readiness to convey the party to
72 Boulogne. As soon as the train stopped, a general rush was made for the
71 steamers; and in a very short time the one in which I had embarked was
70 passing out of the harbour. The boat appeared to be conscious that we
72 were going on a holy mission, and seemed to be proud of her load. There
73 is nothing in this wide world so like a thing of life as a steamer, from
72 the breathing of her steam and smoke, the energy of her motion, and the
69 beauty of her shape; while the ease with which she is managed by the
72 command of a single voice, makes her appear as obedient as the horse is
13 to the rein.
1 
71 When we were about half way between the two great European Powers, the
72 officers began to gather the tickets. The first to whom he applied, and
72 who handed out his "Excursion Ticket," was informed that we were all in
63 the wrong boat. "Is this not one of the boats to take over the
67 delegates?" asked a pretty little lady, with a whining voice. "No,
73 Madam," said the captain. "You must look to the committee for your pay,"
67 said one of the company to the captain. "I have nothing to do with
73 committees," the captain replied. "Your fare, Gentlemen, if you please."
1 
68 Here the whole party were again thrown into confusion. "Do you hear
72 that? We are in the wrong boat." "I knew it would be so," said the Rev.
73 Dr. Ritchie, of Edinburgh. "It is indeed a pretty piece of work," said a
71 plain-looking lady in a handsome bonnet. "When I go travelling again,"
73 said an elderly looking gent with an eye-glass to his face, "I will take
70 the phaeton and old Dobbin." Every one seemed to lay the blame on the
73 committee, and not, too, without some just grounds. However, Mr. Sturge,
68 one of the committee, being in the boat with us, an arrangement was
72 entered into, by which we were not compelled to pay our fare the second
6 time.
1 
67 As we neared the French coast, the first object that attracted our
70 attention was the Napoleon Pillar, on the top of which is a statue of
69 the Emperor in the Imperial robes. We landed, partook of refreshment
65 that had been prepared for us, and again repaired to the railway
73 station. The arrangements for leaving Boulogne were no better than those
73 at London. But after the delay of another hour, we were again in motion.
1 
68 It was a beautiful country through which we passed from Boulogne to
73 Amiens. Straggling cottages which bespeak neatness and comfort abound on
69 every side. The eye wanders over the diversified views with unabated
72 pleasure, and rests in calm repose upon its superlative beauty. Indeed,
71 the eye cannot but be gratified at viewing the entire country from the
72 coast to the metropolis. Sparkling hamlets spring up as the steam horse
63 speeds his way, at almost every point--showing the progress of
60 civilization, and the refinement of the nineteenth century.
1 
70 We arrived at Paris a few minutes past twelve o'clock at night, when,
67 according to our tickets, we should have been there at nine. Elihu
71 Burritt, who had been in Paris some days, and who had the arrangements
73 there pretty much his own way, was at the station waiting the arrival of
68 the train, and we had demonstrated to us, the best evidence that he
70 understood his business. In no other place on the whole route had the
67 affairs been so well managed; for we were seated in our respective
69 carriages and our luggage placed on the top, and away we went to our
73 hotels without the least difficulty or inconvenience. The champion of an
70 "Ocean Penny Postage" received, as he deserved, thanks from the whole
38 company for his admirable management.
1 
73 The silence of the night was only disturbed by the rolling of the wheels
73 of the omnibus, as we passed through the dimly lighted streets. Where, a
67 few months before was to be seen the flash from the cannon and the
71 musket, and the hearing of the cries and groans behind the barricades,
68 was now the stillness of death--nothing save here and there a _gens
52 d'arme_ was to be seen going his rounds in silence.
1 
69 The omnibus set us down at the hotel Bedford, Rue de L'Arend, where,
71 although near one o'clock, we found a good supper waiting for us; and,
70 as I was not devoid of an appetite, I did my share towards putting it
16 out of the way.
1 
73 The next morning I was up at an early hour, and out on the Boulevards to
71 see what might be seen. As I was passing from the Bedford to the Place
67 de La Concord, all at once, and as if by some magic power, I found
73 myself in front of the most splendid edifice imaginable, situated at the
73 end of the Rue Nationale. Seeing a number of persons entering the church
71 at that early hour, and recognising among them my friend the President
71 of the Oberlin (Ohio) Institute, and wishing not to stray too far from
64 my hotel before breakfast, I followed the crowd and entered the
69 building. The church itself consisted of a vast nave, interrupted by
69 four pews on each side, fronted with lofty fluted Corinthian columns
71 standing on pedestals, supporting colossal arches, bearing up cupolas,
70 pierced with skylights and adorned with compartments gorgeously gilt;
72 their corners supported with saints and apostles in _alto relievo_. The
73 walls of the church were lined with rich marble. The different paintings
69 and figures, gave the interior an imposing appearance. On inquiry, I
71 found that I was in the Church of the Madeleine. It was near this spot
72 that some of the most interesting scenes occurred during the Revolution
73 of 1848, which dethroned Louis Philippe. Behind the Madeleine is a small
69 but well supplied market; and on an esplanade east of the edifice, a
47 flower market is held on Tuesdays and Fridays.

1 
49 The first session of the Peace Congress is over.
1 
1 
70 The Congress met this morning at 11 o'clock, in the Salle St. Cecile,
68 Rue de la St. Lazare. The Parisians have no "Exeter Hall:" in fact,
72 there is no private hall in the city of any size, save this, where such
72 a meeting could be held. This hall has been fitted up for the occasion.
67 The room is long, and at one end has a raised platform; and at the
71 opposite end is a gallery, with seats raised one above another. On one
68 side of the hall was a balcony with sofas, which were evidently the
18 "reserved seats."
1 
72 The hall was filled at an early hour with the delegates, their friends,
67 and a good sprinkling of the French. Occasionally, small groups of
69 gentlemen would make their appearance on the platform, until it soon
65 appeared that there was little room left for others; and yet the
68 officers of the Convention had not come in. The different countries
73 were, many of them, represented here. England, France, Belgium, Germany,
66 Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and the United States, had each their
69 delegates. The Assembly began to give signs of impatience, when very
71 soon the train of officials made their appearance amid great applause.
73 Victor Hugo led the way, followed by M. Duguerry, curé of the Madeleine,
71 Elihu Burritt, and a host of others of less note. Victor Hugo took the
70 chair as President of the Congress, supported by Vice-presidents from
72 the several nations represented. Mr. Richard, the Secretary, read a dry
72 report of the names of societies, committees, &c., which was deemed the
27 opening of the Convention.
1 
71 The President then arose, and delivered one of the most impressive and
73 eloquent appeals in favour of peace that could possibly be imagined. The
70 effect produced upon the minds of all present was such as to make the
71 author of "_Notre Dame de Paris_" a great favourite with the Congress.
71 An English gentleman near me said to his friend, "I can't understand a
69 word of what he says, but is it not good?" Victor Hugo concluded his
73 speech amid the greatest enthusiasm on the part of the French, which was
65 followed by hurrahs in the old English style. The Convention was
71 successively addressed by the President of the Brussels Peace Society;
70 President Mahan of the Oberlin (Ohio) Institute, U.S.; Henry Vincent;
70 and Richard Cobden. The latter was not only the _lion_ of the English
73 delegation, but the great man of the Convention. When Mr. Cobden speaks,
71 there is no want of hearers. The great power of this gentleman lies in
67 his facts and his earnestness, for he cannot be called an eloquent
68 speaker. Mr. Cobden addressed the Congress first in French, then in
73 English; and, with the single exception of Mr. Ewart, M.P., was the only
70 one of the English delegation that could speak to the French in their
14 own language.
1 
71 The Congress was brought to a close at five o'clock, when the numerous
70 audience dispersed--the citizens to their homes, and the delegates to
16 see the sights.
1 
71 I was not a little amused at an incident that occurred at the close of
71 the first session. On the passage from America, there were in the same
67 steamer with me, several Americans, and among these, three or four
68 appeared to be much annoyed at the fact that I was a passenger, and
69 enjoying the company of white persons; and although I was not openly
73 insulted, I very often heard the remark, that "That nigger had better be
69 on his master's farm," and "What could the American Peace Society be
73 thinking about to send a black man as a delegate to Paris." Well, at the
72 close of the first sitting of the Convention, and just as I was leaving
71 Victor Hugo, to whom I had been introduced by an M.P., I observed near
69 me a gentleman with his hat in hand, whom I recognized as one of the
73 passengers who had crossed the Atlantic with me in the _Canada_, and who
65 appeared to be the most horrified at having a negro for a fellow
73 passenger. This gentleman, as I left M. Hugo, stepped up to me and said,
73 "How do you do, Mr. Brown?" "You have the advantage of me," said I. "Oh,
69 don't you know me; I was a fellow passenger with you from America; I
73 wish you would give me an introduction to Victor Hugo and Mr. Cobden." I
65 need not inform you that I declined introducing this pro-slavery
73 American to these distinguished men. I only allude to this, to show what
73 a change comes over the dreams of my white American brother, by crossing
71 the ocean. The man who would not have been seen walking with me in the
72 streets of New York, and who would not have shaken hands with me with a
70 pair of tongs while on the passage from the United States, could come
72 with hat in hand in Paris, and say, "I was your fellow-passenger." From
71 the Salle de St. Cecile, I visited the Column Vendome, from the top of
68 which I obtained a fine view of Paris and its environs. This is the
72 Bunker Hill Monument of Paris. On the top of this pillar is a statue of
67 the Emperor Napoleon, eleven feet high. The monument is built with
68 stone, and the outside covered with a metallic composition, made of
67 cannons, guns, spikes, and other warlike implements taken from the
72 Russians and Austrians by Napoleon. Above 1200 cannons were melted down
72 to help to create this monument of folly, to commemorate the success of
70 the French arms in the German Campaign. The column is in imitation of
71 the Trajan pillar at Rome, and is twelve feet in diameter at the base.
64 The door at the bottom of the pillar, and where we entered, was
72 decorated above with crowns of oak, surmounted by eagles, each weighing
71 500 lbs. The bas-relief of the shaft pursues a spiral direction to the
71 capitol, and displays, in a chronological order, the principal actions
70 of the French army, from the departure of the troops from Boulogne to
68 the battle of Austerlitz. The figures are near three feet high, and
72 their number said to be two thousand. This sumptuous monument stands on
71 a plinth of polished granite, surmounted by an iron railing; and, from
69 its size and position, has an imposing appearance when seen from any
18 part of the city.
1 
69 Everything here appears strange and peculiar--the people not less so
73 than their speech. The horses, carriages, furniture, dress, and manners,
71 are in keeping with their language. The appearance of the labourers in
73 caps, resembling nightcaps, seemed particularly strange to me. The women
66 without bonnets, and their caps turned the right side behind, had
70 nothing of the look of our American women. The prettiest woman I ever
71 saw was without a bonnet, walking on the Boulevards. While in Ireland,
71 and during the few days I was in England, I was struck with the marked
68 difference between the appearance of the women from those of my own
62 country. The American women are too tall, too sallow, and too
70 long-featured to be called pretty. This is most probably owing to the
70 fact that in America the people come to maturity earlier than in most
17 other countries.
1 
70 My first night in Paris was spent with interest. No place can present
71 greater street attractions than the Boulevards of Paris. The countless
71 number of cafés, with tables before the doors, and these surrounded by
72 men with long moustaches, with ladies at their sides, whose very smiles
72 give indication of happiness, together with the sound of music from the
73 gardens in the rear, tell the stranger that he is in a different country
14 from his own.

45                     VERSAILLES, _August 24_.
1 
72 After the Convention had finished its sittings yesterday, I accompanied
72 Mrs. M. C---- and sisters to Versailles, where they are residing during
72 the summer. It was really pleasing to see among the hundreds of strange
71 faces in the Convention, those distinguished friends of the slave from
8 Boston.
1 
70 Mrs. C----'s residence is directly in front of the great palace where
71 so many kings have made their homes, the prince of whom was Louis XIV.
64 The palace is now unoccupied. No ruler has dared to take up his
73 residence here since Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette were driven from it
71 by the mob from Paris on the 8th of October, 1789. The town looks like
64 the wreck of what it once was. At the commencement of the first
70 revolution, it contained one hundred thousand inhabitants; now it has
72 only about thirty thousand. It seems to be going back to what it was in
70 the time of Louis XIII., when in 1624 he built a small brick chateau,
68 and from it arose the magnificent palace which now stands here, and
60 which attracts strangers to it from all parts of the world.
1 
73 I arose this morning before the sun, and took a walk through the grounds
73 of the Palace, and remained three hours among the fountains and statuary
69 of this more than splendid place. But as I intend spending some days
72 here, and shall have better opportunities of seeing and judging, I will
50 defer my remarks upon Versailles for the present.
1 
71 Yesterday was a great day in the Congress. The session was opened by a
71 speech from M. Coquerel, the Protestant clergyman in Paris. His speech
73 was received with much applause, and seemed to create great sensation in
73 the Congress, especially at the close of his remarks, when he was seized
62 by the hand by the Abbe Duguerry, amid the most deafening and
68 enthusiastic applause of the entire multitude. The meeting was then
69 addressed in English by a short gentleman, of florid complexion. His
69 words seemed to come without the least difficulty, and his jestures,
71 though somewhat violent, were evidently studied; and the applause with
73 which he was greeted by the English delegation, showed that he was a man
72 of no little distinction among them. His speech was one continuous flow
65 of rapid, fervid eloquence, that seemed to fire every heart; and
70 although I disliked his style, I was prepossessed in his favour. This
64 was Henry Vincent, and his speech was in favour of disarmament.
1 
68 Mr. Vincent was followed by M. Emile de Girardin, the editor of _La
73 Presse_, in one of the most eloquent speeches that I ever heard; and his
71 exclamation of "Soldiers of Peace," drew thunders of applause from his
72 own countrymen. M. Girardin is not only the leader of the French press,
69 but is a writer on politics of great distinction, and a leader of no
70 inconsiderable party in the National Assembly; although still a young
66 man, apparently not more than thirty-eight or forty years of age.
1 
69 After a speech from Mr. Ewart, M.P., in French, and another from Mr.
71 Cobden in the same language, the Convention was brought to a close for
73 the day. I spent the morning yesterday, in visiting some of the lions of
70 the French capital, among which was the Louvre. The French Government
72 having kindly ordered, that the members of the Peace Congress should be
66 admitted free, and without ticket, to all the public works, I had
69 nothing to do but present my card of membership, and was immediately
10 admitted.
1 
71 The first room I entered, was nearly a quarter of a mile in length; is
71 known as the "Long Gallery," and contains some of the finest paintings
71 in the world. On entering this superb palace, my first impression was,
67 that all Christendom had been robbed, that the Louvre might make a
67 splendid appearance. This is the Italian department, and one would
73 suppose by its appearance that but few paintings had been left in Italy.
68 The entrance end of the Louvre was for a long time in an unfinished
72 state, but was afterwards completed by that master workman, the Emperor
67 Napoleon. It was long thought that the building would crumble into
66 decay, but the genius of the great Corsican rescued it from ruin.
1 
73 During our walk through the Louvre, we saw some twenty or thirty artists
70 copying paintings; some had their copies finished and were going out,
73 others half done, while many had just commenced. I remained some minutes
72 near a pretty French girl, who was copying a painting of a dog rescuing
57 a child from a stream of water into which it had fallen.
1 
67 I walked down one side of the hall and up the other, and was about
69 leaving, when I was informed that this was only one room, and that a
73 half-dozen more were at my service; but a clock on a neighbouring church
69 reminded me that I must quit the Louvre for the Salle de St. Cecile.
1 
41        *       *       *       *       *
1 
69 This morning the Hall was filled at an early hour with rather a more
66 fashionable looking audience than on any former occasion, and all
69 appeared anxious for the Congress to commence its session, as it was
73 understood to be the last day. After the reading of several letters from
73 gentlemen, apologising for their not being able to attend, the speech of
64 Elihu Burritt was read by a son of M. Coquerel. I felt somewhat
66 astonished that my countryman, who was said to be master of fifty
61 languages, had to get some one to read his speech in French.
1 
70 The Abbe Duguerry now came forward amid great cheering, and said that
71 "the eminent journalist, Girardin, and the great English logician, Mr.
65 Cobden, had made it unnecessary for any further advocacy in that
69 assembly of the Peace cause--that if the principles laid down in the
71 resolutions were carried out, the work would be done. He said that the
65 question of general pacification was built on truth--truth which
72 emanated from God--and it were as vain to undertake to prevent air from
63 expanding as to check the progress of truth. It must and would
10 prevail."
1 
72 A pale, thin-faced gentleman next ascended the platform (or tribune, as
71 it was called) amid shouts of applause from the English, and began his
67 speech in rather a low tone, when compared with the sharp voice of
72 Vincent, or the thunder of the Abbe Duguerry. An audience is not apt to
71 be pleased or even contented with an inferior speaker, when surrounded
65 by eloquent men, and I looked every moment for manifestations of
73 disapprobation, as I felt certain that the English delegation had made a
64 mistake in applauding this gentleman who seemed to make such an
69 unpromising beginning. But the speaker soon began to get warm on the
69 subject, and even at times appeared as if he had spoken before. In a
71 very short time, with the exception of his own voice, the stillness of
73 death prevailed throughout the building. The speaker, in the delivery of
70 one of the most logical speeches made in the Congress, and despite of
67 his thin, sallow look, interested me much more than any whom I had
69 before heard. Towards the close of his remarks, he was several times
73 interrupted by manifestations of approbation; and finally concluded amid
71 great cheering. I inquired the gentleman's name, and was informed that
52 it was Edward Miall, editor of the _Nonconformist_.
1 
70 After speeches from several others, the great Peace Congress of 1849,
66 which had brought men together from nearly all the governments of
72 Europe, and many from America, was brought to a final close by a speech
66 from the President, returning thanks for the honour that had been
72 conferred upon him. He said, "My address shall be short, and yet I have
70 to bid you adieu! How resolve to do so? Here, during three days, have
72 questions of the deepest import been discussed, examined, probed to the
66 bottom; and during these discussions, counsels have been given to
65 governments which they will do well to profit by. If these days'
70 sittings are attended with no other result, they will be the means of
68 sowing in the minds of those present, gems of cordiality which must
70 ripen into good fruit. England, France, Belgium, Europe, and America,
72 would all be drawn closer by these sittings. Yet the moment to part has
73 arrived, but I can feel that we are strongly united in heart. But before
63 parting I may congratulate you and myself on the result of our
69 proceedings. We have been all joined together without distinction of
72 country; we have all been united in one common feeling during our three
72 days' communion. The good work cannot go back, it must advance, it must
72 be accomplished. The course of the future may be judged of by the sound
72 of the footsteps of the past. In the course of that day's discussion, a
70 reminiscence had been handed up to one of the speakers, that this was
70 the anniversary of the dreadful massacre of St. Bartholomew: the rev.
64 gentleman who was speaking turned away from the thought of that
71 sanguinary scene with pious horror, natural to his sacred calling. But
73 I, who may boast of firmer nerve, I take up the remembrance. Yes, it was
69 on this day, two hundred and seventy-seven years ago, that Paris was
69 roused from slumber by the sound of that bell which bore the name of
71 _cloche d'argent_. Massacre was on foot, seeking with keen eye for its
72 victim--man was busy in slaying man. That slaughter was called forth by
73 mingled passions of the worst description. Hatred of all kinds was there
69 urging on the slayer--hatred of a religious, a political, a personal
73 character. And yet on the anniversary of that same day of horror, and in
68 that very city whose blood was flowing like water, has God this day
69 given a rendezvous to men of peace, whose wild tumult is transformed
72 into order, and animosity into love. The stain of blood is blotted out,
71 and in its place beams forth a ray of holy light. All distinctions are
70 removed, and Papist and Huguenot meet together in friendly communion.
73 (Loud cheers.) Who that thinks of these amazing changes can doubt of the
70 progress that has been made? But whoever denies the force of progress
70 must deny God, since progress is the boon of Providence, and emanated
69 from the great Being above. I feel gratified for the change that has
73 been effected, and, pointing solemnly to the past, I say let this day be
70 ever held memorable--let the 24th of August, 1572, be remembered only
69 for the purpose of being compared with the 24th of August, 1849; and
71 when we think of the latter, and ponder over the high purpose to which
73 it has been devoted--the advocacy of the principles of peace--let us not
70 be so wanting in reliance on Providence as to doubt for one moment of
41 the eventful success of our holy cause."
1 
73 The most enthusiastic cheers followed this interesting speech. A vote of
72 thanks to the government, and three times three cheers, with Mr. Cobden
55 as "fugleman," ended the great Peace Congress of 1849.
1 
71 Time for separating had arrived, yet all seemed unwilling to leave the
70 place, where for three days men of all creeds and of no creed had met
66 upon one common platform. In one sense the meeting was a glorious
69 one--in another, it was mere child's play; for the Congress had been
71 restricted to the discussion of certain topics. They were permitted to
70 dwell on the blessings of peace, but were not allowed to say anything
71 about the very subjects above all others that should have been brought
69 before the Congress. A French army had invaded Rome and put down the
71 friends of political and religious freedom, yet not a word was said in
70 reference to it. The fact is, the Committee permitted the Congress to
73 be _gagged_, before it had met. They put padlocks upon their own mouths,
72 and handed the keys to the government. And this was sorely felt by many
73 of the speakers. Richard Cobden, who had thundered his anathemas against
71 the Corn Laws of his own country, and against wars in every clime, had
73 to sit quiet in his fetters. Henry Vincent, who can make a louder speech
71 in favour of peace, than almost any other man, and whose denunciations
73 of "all war," have gained him no little celebrity with peace men, had to
66 confine himself to the blessings of peace. Oh! how I wished for a
66 Massachusetts atmosphere, a New England Convention platform, with
70 Wendell Phillips as the speaker, before that assembled multitude from
24 all parts of the world.
1 
73 But the Congress is over, and cannot now be made different; yet it is to
68 be hoped that neither the London Peace Committee, nor any other men
72 having the charge of getting up such another great meeting, will commit
21 such an error again.

1 
73 The day after the close of the Congress, the delegates and their friends
68 were invited to a soirée by M. de Tocqueville, Minister for Foreign
66 Affairs, to take place on the next evening (Saturday); and, as my
73 coloured face and curly hair did not prevent my getting an invitation, I
48 was present with the rest of my peace brethren.
1 
71 Had I been in America, where colour is considered a crime, I would not
73 have been seen at such a gathering, unless as a servant. In company with
68 several delegates, we left the Bedford Hotel for the mansion of the
66 Minister of Foreign Affairs; and, on arriving, we found a file of
70 soldiers drawn up before the gate. This did not seem much like peace:
69 however, it was merely done in honour of the company. We entered the
72 building through massive doors and resigned ourselves into the hands of
67 good-looking waiters in white wigs; and, after our names were duly
72 announced, were passed from room to room till I was presented to Madame
62 de Tocqueville, who was standing near the centre of the large
71 drawing-room, with a bouquet in her hand. I was about passing on, when
66 the gentleman who introduced me intimated that I was an "American
73 slave." At the announcement of this fact the distinguished lady extended
73 her hand and gave me a cordial welcome--at the same time saying, "I hope
69 you feel yourself free in Paris." Having accepted an invitation to a
73 seat by the lady's side, who seated herself on a sofa, I was soon what I
71 most dislike, "the observed of all observers." I recognised among many
70 of my own countrymen, who were gazing at me, the American Consul, Mr.
69 Walsh. My position did not improve his looks. The company present on
71 this occasion were variously estimated at from one thousand to fifteen
71 hundred. Among these were the Ambassadors from the different countries
72 represented at the French metropolis, and many of the _elite_ of Paris.
73 One could not but be interested with the difference in dress, looks, and
72 manners of this assemblage of strangers whose language was as different
73 as their general appearance. Delight seemed to beam in every countenance
69 as the living stream floated from one room to another. The house and
73 gardens were illuminated in the most gorgeous manner. Red, yellow, blue,
73 green, and many other coloured lamps, suspended from the branches of the
72 trees in the gardens, gave life and animation to the whole scene out of
67 doors. The soirée passed off satisfactorily to all parties; and by
40 twelve o'clock I was again at my Hotel.
1 
41        *       *       *       *       *
1 
69 Through the politeness of the government the members of the Congress
72 have not only had the pleasure of seeing all the public works free, and
69 without special ticket, but the palaces of Versailles and St. Cloud,
69 together with their splendid grounds, have been thrown open, and the
72 water-works set to playing in both places. This mark of respect for the
67 Peace movement is commendable in the French; and were I not such a
73 strenuous friend of free speech, this act would cause me to overlook the
64 padlocks that the government put upon our lips in the Congress.
1 
71 Two long trains left Paris at nine o'clock for Versailles; and at each
70 of the stations the company were loudly cheered by the people who had
69 assembled to see them pass. At Versailles, we found thousands at the
73 station, who gave us a most enthusiastic welcome. We were blessed with a
71 goodly number of the fair sex, who always give life and vigour to such
66 scenes. The train had scarcely stopped, ere the great throng were
69 wending their ways in different directions, some to the cafés to get
70 what an early start prevented their getting before leaving Paris, and
73 others to see the soldiers who were on review. But most bent their steps
26 towards the great palace.
1 
69 At eleven o'clock we were summoned to the _dejeuner_, which had been
71 prepared by the English delegates in honour of their American friends.
69 About six hundred sat down at the tables. Breakfast being ended, Mr.
69 Cobden was called to the chair, and several speeches were made. Many
68 who had not an opportunity to speak at the Congress, thought this a
73 good chance; and the written addresses which had been studied during the
70 passage from America, with the hope that they would immortalize their
73 authors before the great Congress, were produced at the breakfast table.
68 But speech-making was not the order of the day. Too many thundering
70 addresses had been delivered in the Salle de St. Cecile, to allow the
70 company to sit and hear dryly written and worse delivered speeches in
16 the Teniscourt.
1 
72 There was no limited time given to the speakers, yet no one had been on
70 his feet five minutes, before the cry was heard from all parts of the
73 house, "Time, time." One American was hissed down, another took his seat
71 with a red face, and a third opened his bundle of paper, looked around
72 at the audience, made a bow, and took his seat amid great applause. Yet
70 some speeches were made, and to good effect, the best of which was by
67 Elihu Burritt, who was followed by the Rev. James Freeman Clark. I
71 regretted very much that the latter did not deliver his address before
66 the Congress, for he is a man of no inconsiderable talent, and an
34 acknowledged friend of the slave.
1 
70 The cry of "The water-works are playing," "The water is on," broke up
68 the meeting, without even a vote of thanks to the Chairman; and the
73 whole party were soon revelling among the fountains and statues of Louis
68 XIV. Description would fail to give a just idea of the grandeur and
73 beauty of this splendid place. I do not think that any thing can surpass
70 the fountain of Neptune, which stands near the Grand Trianon. One may
71 easily get lost in wandering through the grounds of Versailles, but he
67 will always be in sight of some life-like statue. These monuments,
73 erected to gratify the fancy of a licentious king, make their appearance
71 at every turn. Two lions, the one overturning a wild boar, the other a
71 wolf, both the production of Fillen, pointed out to us the fountain of
65 Diana. But I will not attempt to describe to you any of the very
46 beautiful sculptured gods and goddesses here.
1 
73 With a single friend I paid a visit to the two Trianons. The larger was,
64 we were told, just as king Louis Philippe left it. One room was
70 splendidly fitted up for the reception of Her Majesty Queen Victoria;
68 who, it appeared, had promised a visit to the French Court; but the
69 French Monarch ran away from his throne before the time arrived. The
72 Grand Trianon is not larger than many noblemen's seats that may be seen
73 in a day's ride through any part of the British empire. The building has
59 only a ground floor, but its proportions are very elegant.
1 
72 We next paid our respects to the Little Trianon. This appears to be the
70 most Republican of any of the French palaces. I inspected this little
71 palace with much interest, not more for its beauty than because of its
71 having been the favourite residence of that purest of Princesses, best
67 of Queens, and most affectionate of mothers, Marie Antoinette. The
71 grounds and building may be said to be only a palace in miniature, and
67 this makes it still a more lovely spot. The building consists of a
66 square pavilion two stories high, and separated entirely from the
68 accessory buildings, which are on the left, and among them a pretty
71 chapel. But a wish to be with the multitude, who were roving among the
47 fountains, cut short my visit to the trianons.
1 
70 The day was very fine, and the whole party seemed to enjoy it. It was
63 said that there were more than one hundred thousand persons at
72 Versailles during the day. The company appeared to lose themselves with
69 the pleasure of walking among the trees, flower beds, fountains, and
68 statues. I met more than one wife seeking a lost husband, and _vice
72 versa_. Many persons were separated from their friends and did not meet
73 them again till at the hotels in Paris. In the train returning to Paris,
73 an old gentleman who was seated near me said, "I would rest contented if
44 I thought I should ever see my wife again!"
1 
68 At four o'clock we were _en route_ to St. Cloud, the much loved and
70 favourite residence of the Emperor Napoleon. It seemed that all Paris
69 had come out to St. Cloud to see how the English and Americans would
67 enjoy the playing of the water-works. Many kings and rulers of the
68 French have made St. Cloud their residence, but none have impressed
72 their images so indelibly upon it as Napoleon. It was here he was first
66 elevated to power, and here Josephine spent her most happy hours.
1 
71 The apartments where Napoleon was married to Marie Louise; the private
71 rooms of Josephine and Marie Antoinette, were all in turn shown to us.
70 While standing on the balcony looking at Paris one cannot wonder that
73 the Emperor should have selected this place as his residence, for a more
44 lovely spot cannot be found than St. Cloud.
1 
68 The palace is on the side of a hill, two leagues from Paris, and so
69 situated that it looks down upon the French capital. Standing, as we
71 did, viewing Paris from St. Cloud, and the setting sun reflecting upon
72 the domes, spires, and towers of the city of fashion, made us feel that
69 this was the place from which the monarch should watch his subjects.
71 From the hour of arrival at St. Cloud till near eight o'clock, we were
65 either inspecting the splendid palace or roaming the grounds and
71 gardens, whose beautiful walks and sweet flowers made it appear a very
19 Paradise on earth.
1 
72 At eight o'clock the water-works were put in motion, and the variagated
70 lamps with their many devices, displaying flowers, stars, and wheels,
70 all with a brilliancy that can scarcely be described, seemed to throw
71 everything in the shade we had seen at Versailles. At nine o'clock the
73 train was announced, and after a good deal of jamming and pushing about,
35 we were again on the way to Paris.

40                     PARIS, _August 28_.
1 
67 Yesterday morning I started at an early hour for the Palace of the
70 Tuileries. A show of my card of membership of the Congress (which had
71 carried me through so many of the public buildings) was enough to gain
73 me immediate admission. The attack of the mob on the palace, on the 20th
72 of June, 1792, the massacre of the Swiss guard on the 10th of August of
72 the same year, the attack by the people in July 1830, together with the
68 recent flight of king Louis Philippe and family, made me anxious to
20 visit the old pile.
1 
68 We were taken from room to room, until the entire building had been
72 inspected. In front of the Tuileries, are a most magnificent garden and
71 grounds. These were all laid out by Louis XIV., and are left nearly as
71 they were during that monarch's reign. Above fifty acres surrounded by
73 an iron rail fence, fronts the Place de la Concorde, and affords a place
71 of promenade for the Parisians. I walked the pleasing grounds, and saw
70 hundreds of well dressed persons walking under the shade of the great
69 chestnuts, or sitting on chairs which were kept to let at two sous a
67 piece. Near by is the Place de Carrousel, noted for its historical
68 remembrances. Many incidents connected with the several revolutions
65 occurred here, and it is pointed out as the place where Napoleon
70 reviewed that formidable army of his before its departure for Russia.
1 
70 From the Tuileries, I took a stroll through the Place de la Concorde,
69 which has connected with it so many acts of cruelty, that it made me
72 shudder as I passed over its grounds. As if to take from one's mind the
73 old associations of this place, the French have erected on it, or rather
68 given a place to, the celebrated obelisk of Luxor, which now is the
71 chief attraction on the grounds. The obelisk was brought from Egypt at
69 an enormous expense; for which purpose a ship was built, and several
71 hundred men employed above three years in its removal. It is formed of
69 the finest red syenite, and covered on each side with three lines of
72 hieroglyphic inscriptions, commemorative of Sesostris--the middle lines
63 being the most deeply cut and most carefully finished; and the
72 characters altogether number more than 1600. The obelisk is of a single
72 stone, is 72 feet in height, weighs 500,000 lbs., and stands on a block
72 of granite that weighs 250,000 lbs. He who can read Latin will see that
68 the monument tells its own story, but to me its characters were all
7 blank.
1 
68 It would be tedious to follow the history of this old and venerated
70 stone, which was taken from the quarry 1550 years before the birth of
68 Christ; placed in Thebes; its removal; the journey to the Nile, and
71 down the Nile; thence to Cherbourg, and lastly its arrival in Paris on
72 the 23d of December, 1833--just one year before I escaped from slavery.
71 The obelisk was raised on the spot where it now stands, on the 25th of
72 October, 1836, in the presence of Louis Philippe and amid the greetings
20 of 160,000 persons.
1 
73 Having missed my dinner, I crossed over to the Palais Royal, to a dining
69 saloon, and can assure you that a better dinner may be had there for
65 five francs, than can be got in New York for twice that sum, and
73 especially if the person who wants the dinner is a coloured man. I found
56 no prejudice against my complexion in the Palais Royal.
1 
69 Many of the rooms in this once abode of Royalty, are most splendidly
67 furnished, and decorated with valuable pictures. The likenesses of
68 Madame de Stael, J.J. Rousseau, Cromwell, and Francis I., are among
6 them.

71 After several unsuccessful attempts to-day, in company with R.D. Webb,
61 Esq., to seek out the house where once resided the notorious
68 Robespierre, I was fortunate enough to find it, but not until I had
69 lost the company of my friend. The house is No. 396, Rue St. Honore,
73 opposite the Church of the Assumption. It stands back, and is reached by
68 entering a court. During the first revolution it was occupied by M.
72 Duplay, with whom Robespierre lodged. The room used by the great man of
73 the revolution, was pointed out to me. It is small, and the ceiling low,
73 with two windows looking out upon the court. The pin upon which the blue
68 coat once hung, is still in the wall. While standing there, I could
68 almost imagine that I saw the great "Incorruptible," sitting at the
70 small table composing those speeches which gave him so much power and
43 influence in the Convention and the Clubs.
1 
71 Here, the disciple of Rousseau sat and planned how he should outdo his
66 enemies and hold on to his friends. From this room he went forth,
72 followed by his dog Brunt, to take his solitary walk in a favourite and
64 neighbouring field, or to the fiery discussions of the National
73 Convention. In the same street, is the house in which Madame Roland--one
35 of Robespierre's victims--resided.
1 
67 A view of the residence of one of the master spirits of the French
72 revolution inclined me to search out more, and therefore I proceeded to
71 the old town, and after winding through several small streets--some of
68 them so narrow as not to admit more than one cab at a time--I found
73 myself in the Rue de L'Ecole de Medecine, and standing in front of house
73 No. 20. This was the residence, during the early days of the revolution,
49 of that bloodthirsty demon in human form, Marat.
1 
72 I said to a butcher, whose shop was underneath, that I wanted to see La
71 Chambre de Marat. He called out to the woman of the house to know if I
66 could be admitted, and the reply was, that the room was used as a
43 sleeping apartment, and could not be seen.
1 
73 As this was private property, my blue card of membership to the Congress
72 was not available. But after slipping a franc into the old lady's hand,
67 I was informed that the room was now ready. We entered a court and
73 ascended a flight of stairs, the entrance to which is on the right; then
70 crossing to the left, we were shown into a moderate-sized room on the
73 first floor, with two windows looking out upon a yard. Here it was where
71 the "Friend of the People" (as he styled himself,) sat and wrote those
72 articles that appeared daily in his journal, urging the people to "hang
71 the rich upon lamp posts." The place where the bath stood, in which he
71 was bathing at the time he was killed by Charlotte Corday, was pointed
69 out to us; and even something representing an old stain of blood was
69 shown as the place where he was laid when taken out of the bath. The
73 window, behind whose curtains the heroine hid, after she had plunged the
71 dagger into the heart of the man whom she thought was the cause of the
68 shedding of so much blood by the guillotine, was pointed out with a
42 seeming degree of pride by the old woman.
1 
66 With my Guide Book in hand, I again went forth to "hunt after new
10 fancies."
1 
41        *       *       *       *       *
1 
71 After walking over the ground where the guillotine once stood, cutting
69 off its hundred and fifty heads per day, and then visiting the place
66 where some of the chief movers in that sanguinary revolution once
65 lived, I felt little disposed to sleep, when the time for it had
70 arrived. However, I was out this morning at an early hour, and on the
63 Champs Elysees; and again took a walk over the place where the
70 guillotine stood, when its fatal blade was sending so many unprepared
70 spirits into eternity. When standing here, you have the Palace of the
70 Tuileries on one side, the arch on the other; on a third, the classic
72 Madeleine; and on the fourth, the National Assembly. It caused my blood
69 to chill, the idea of being on the identical spot where the heads of
71 Louis XVI. and his Queen, after being cut off, were held up to satisfy
69 the blood-thirsty curiosity of the two hundred thousand persons that
73 were assembled on the Place de la Revolution. Here Royal blood flowed as
73 it never did before or since. The heads of patricians and plebians, were
69 thrown into the same basket, without any regard to birth or station.
72 Here Robespierre and Danton had stood again and again, and looked their
72 victims in the face as they ascended the scaffold; and here, these same
71 men had to mount the very scaffold that they had erected for others. I
68 wandered up the Seine, till I found myself looking at the statue of
73 Henry the IV. over the principal entrance of the Hotel de Ville. When we
64 take into account the connection of the Hotel de Ville with the
73 different revolutions, we must come to the conclusion, that it is one of
71 the most remarkable buildings in Paris. The room was pointed out where
70 Robespierre held his counsels, and from the windows of which he could
72 look out upon the Place de Greve, where the guillotine stood before its
68 removal to the Place de la Concorde. The room is large, with gilded
71 hangings, splendid old-fashioned chandeliers, and a chimney-piece with
68 fine antiquated carvings, that give it a venerable appearance. Here
72 Robespierre not only presided at the counsels that sent hundreds to the
71 guillotine; but from this same spot, he, with his brother St. Just and
71 others, were dragged before the Committee of Public Safety, and thence
54 to the guillotine, and justice and revenge satisfied.
1 
66 The window from which Lafayette addressed the people in 1830, and
73 presented to them Louis Philippe, as the king, was shown to us. Here the
70 poet, statesman, philosopher and orator, Lamartine, stood in February
67 1848, and, by the power of his eloquence, succeeded in keeping the
71 people quiet. Here he forced the mob, braved the bayonets presented to
67 his breast, and, by his good reasoning, induced them to retain the
73 tri-coloured flag, instead of adopting the red flag, which he considered
21 the emblem of blood.
1 
71 Lamartine is a great heroic genius, dear to liberty and to France; and
71 successive generations, as they look back upon the revolution of 1848,
71 will recall to memory the many dangers which nothing but his dauntless
70 courage warded off. The difficulties which his wisdom surmounted, and
69 the good service that he rendered to France, can never be adequately
71 estimated or too highly appreciated. It was at the Hotel de Ville that
51 the Republic of 1848 was proclaimed to the people.
1 
70 I next paid my respects to the Column of July that stands on the spot
71 formerly occupied by the Bastile. It is 163 feet in height, and on the
73 top is the Genius of Liberty, with a torch in his right hand, and in the
66 left a broken chain. After a fatiguing walk up a winding stair, I
62 obtained a splendid view of Paris from the top of the column.
1 
68 I thought I should not lose the opportunity of seeing the Church de
73 Notre Dame while so near to it, and, therefore, made it my next rallying
67 point. No edifice connected with religion has had more interesting
68 incidents occurring in it than this old church. Here Pope Pius VII.
65 placed the Imperial Crown on the head of the Corsican--or rather
70 Napoleon took the Crown from his hands and placed it on his own head.
69 Satan dragging the wicked to ----; the rider on the red horse at the
71 opening of the second seal; the blessedness of the saints; and several
69 other striking sculptured figures were among the many curiosities in
73 this splendid place. A hasty view from the gallery concluded my visit to
16 the Notre Dame.
1 
71 Leaving the old church I strayed off in a direction towards the Seine,
65 and passed by an old looking building of stately appearance, and
71 recognised, among a throng passing in and out, a number of the members
70 of the Peace Congress. I joined a party entering, and was soon in the
65 presence of men with gowns on, and men with long staffs in their
65 hands--and on inquiry found that I was in the Palais de Justice;
72 beneath which is the Conciergerie, a noted prison. Louis XVI. and Marie
51 Antoinette were tried and condemned to death here.
1 
67 A bas-relief, by Cortat, representing Louis in conference with his
69 Counsel, is here seen. But I had visited too many places of interest
70 during the day to remain long in a building surrounded by officers of
48 justice, and took a stroll upon the Boulevards.
1 
73 The Boulevards may be termed the Regent Street of Paris, or a New Yorker
72 would call them Broadway. While passing a café, my German friend Faigo,
72 whose company I had enjoyed during the passage from America, recognised
73 me, and I sat down and took a cup of delicious coffee for the first time
72 on the side walk, in sight of hundreds who were passing up and down the
72 street every hour. From three till eleven o'clock, P.M., the Boulevards
69 are lined with men and women sitting before the doors of the saloons
71 drinking their coffee or wines, or both at the same time, as fancy may
71 dictate. All Paris appeared to be on the Boulevards, and looking as if
42 the great end of this life was enjoyment.

1 
73 Anxious to see as much as possible of Paris in the limited time I had to
73 stay in it, I hired a cab yesterday morning and commenced with the Hotel
72 des Invalids, a magnificent building, within a few minutes' walk of the
65 National Assembly. On each side of the entrance gate are figures
71 representing nations conquered by Louis XIV., with colossal statues of
72 Mars and Minerva. The dome on the edifice is the loftiest in Paris--the
39 height from the ground being 323 feet.
1 
68 Immediately below the dome is the tomb of the man at whose word the
73 world turned pale. A statue of the Emperor Napoleon stands in the second
37 piazza, and is of the finest bronze.
1 
70 This building is the home of the pensioned soldiers of France. It was
69 enough to make one sick at the idea of war, to look upon the mangled
73 bodies of these old soldiers. Men with arms and no legs; others had legs
72 but no arms; some with canes and crutches, and some wheeling themselves
73 about in little hand carts. About three thousand of the decayed soldiers
72 were lodged in the Hotel des Invalids, at the time of my visit. Passing
71 the National Assembly on my return, I spent a moment or two in it. The
71 interior of this building resembles an amphitheatre. It is constructed
71 to accommodate 900 members, each having a separate desk. The seat upon
69 which the Duchesse of Orleans, and her son, the Comte de Paris, sat,
66 when they visited the National Assembly after the flight of Louis
72 Philippe, was shown with considerable alacrity. As I left the building,
71 I heard that the President of the Republic was on the point of leaving
71 the Elysee for St. Cloud, and with the hope of seeing the "Prisoner of
54 Ham," I directed my cabman to drive me to the Elysee.
1 
73 In a few moments we were between two files of soldiers, and entering the
70 gates of the palace. I called out to the driver and told him to stop;
73 but I was too late, for we were now in front of the massive doors of the
72 palace, and a liveried servant opened the cab door, bowed, and asked if
67 I had an engagement with the President. You may easily "guess" his
71 surprise when I told him no. In my best French, I asked the cabman why
71 he had come to the palace, and was answered, "You told me to." By this
68 time a number had gathered round, all making inquiries as to what I
72 wanted. I told the driver to retrace his steps, and, amid the shrugs of
66 their shoulders, the nods of their heads, and the laughter of the
68 soldiers, I left the Elysee without even a sight of the President's
72 mustaches for my trouble. This was only one of the many mistakes I made
16 while in Paris.

11 the Poet._
1 
1 
45                     VERSAILLES, _August 31_.
1 
72 Here I am, within ten leagues of Paris, spending the time pleasantly in
66 viewing the palace and grounds of the great Chateau of Louis XIV.
69 Fifty-seven years ago, a mob, composed of men, women, and boys, from
71 Paris, stood in front of this palace and demanded that the king should
70 go with them to the capital. I have walked over the same ground where
73 the one hundred thousand stood on that interesting occasion. I have been
64 upon the same balcony, and stood by the window from which Maria
63 Antoinette looked out upon the mob that were seeking her life.
1 
72 Anxious to see as much of the palace as I could, and having an offer of
68 the company of my young friend, Henry G. Chapman, to go through the
71 palace with me, I set out early yesterday morning, and was soon in the
68 halls that had often been trod by Royal feet. We passed through the
71 private, as well as the public, apartments, through the secret door by
72 which Marie Antoinette had escaped from the mob of 1792, and viewed the
72 room in which her faithful guards were killed, while attempting to save
66 their Royal mistress. I took my seat in one of the little parlour
69 carriages that had been used in days of yore for the Royal children;
67 while my friend, H.G. Chapman, drew me across the room. The superb
68 apartments are not now in use. Silence is written upon these walls,
72 although upon them are suspended the portraits of men of whom the world
11 has heard.
1 
69 Paintings, representing Napoleon in nearly all his battles, are here
72 seen; and wherever you see the Emperor, there you will also find Murat,
70 with his white plume waving above. Callot's painting of the battle of
67 Marengo, Hue's of the retaking of Genoa, and Bouchat's of the 18th
73 Brumaire, are of the highest order; while David has transmitted his fame
73 to posterity, by his splendid painting of the Coronation of Napoleon and
73 Josephine in Notre Dame. When I looked upon the many beautiful paintings
72 of the last named artist, that adorn the halls of Versailles, I did not
73 wonder that his fame should have saved his life, when once condemned and
73 sentenced to death during the reign of terror. The guillotine was robbed
73 of its intended victim, but the world gained a great painter. As Boswell
71 transmitted his own name to posterity with his life of Johnson, so has
70 David left his, with the magnificent paintings that are now suspended
71 upon the walls of the palaces of the Louvre, the Tuileries, St. Cloud,
40 Versailles, and even the little Elysee.
1 
70 After strolling from room to room, we found ourselves in the Salle du
72 Sacre, Diane, Salon de Mars, de Mercure, and d'Apollon. I gazed with my
71 eyes turned to the ceiling till I was dizzy. The Salon de la Guerre is
69 covered with the most beautiful representations that the mind of man
70 could conceive, or the hand accomplish. Louis XIV. is here in all his
67 glory. No Marie Antoinette will ever do the honours in these halls
7 again.
1 
69 After spending a whole day in the Palace and several mornings in the
69 Gardens, I finally bid adieu to the bronze statue of Louis XIV. that
71 stands in front of the Palace, and left Versailles, probably for ever.

42                     PARIS, _September 2_.
1 
73 I am now on the point of quitting the French Metropolis. I have occupied
70 the last two days in visiting places of note in the city. I could not
73 resist the inclination to pay a second visit to the Louvre. Another hour
64 was spent in strolling through the Italian Hall and viewing the
72 master-workmanship of Raphael, the prince of painters. Time flies, even
73 in such a place as the Louvre with all its attractions; and before I had
69 seen half that I wished, a ponderous clock near by reminded me of an
69 engagement, and I reluctantly tore myself from the splendours of the
7 place.
1 
71 During the rest of the day I visited the Jardin des Plantes, and spent
71 an hour and a half pleasantly in walking among plants, flowers, and in
71 fact everything that could be found in any garden in France. From this
71 place we passed by the column of the Bastile, and paid our respects to
71 the Bourse, or Exchange, one of the most superb buildings in the city.
70 The ground floor and sides of the Bourse, are of fine marble, and the
72 names of the chief cities in the world are inscribed on the medallions,
69 which are under the upper cornice. The interior of the edifice has a
42 most splendid appearance as you enter it.
1 
69 The Cemetery of Père la Chaise was too much talked of by many of our
72 party at the Hotel for me to pass it by, so I took it after the Bourse.
73 Here lie many of the great marshals of France--the resting place of each
72 marked by the monument that stands over it, except one, which is marked
68 only by a weeping willow and a plain stone at its head. This is the
72 grave of Marshal Ney. I should not have known that it was his, but some
70 unknown hand had written with black paint, "Bravest of the Brave," on
69 the unlettered stone that stands at the head of the man who followed
68 Napoleon through nearly all his battles, and who was shot after the
70 occupation of Paris by the allied army. Peace to his ashes. During my
70 ramble through this noted place, I saw several who were hanging fresh
61 wreaths of everlasting flowers on the tombs of the departed.
1 
65 A ride in an omnibus down the Boulevards, and away up the Champs
73 Elysees, brought me to the Arc de Triomphe; and after ascending a flight
66 of one hundred and sixty-one steps, I was overlooking the city of
70 statuary. This stupendous monument was commenced by Napoleon in 1806;
66 and in 1811 it had only reached the cornice of the base, where it
71 stopped, and it was left for Louis Philippe to finish. The first stone
72 of this monument was laid on the 15th of August, 1806, the birth-day of
69 the man whose battles it was intended to commemorate. A model of the
69 arch was erected for Napoleon to pass through as he was entering the
70 city with Maria Louisa, after their marriage. The inscriptions on the
72 monument are many, and the different scenes here represented are all of
67 the most exquisite workmanship. The genius of War is summoning the
72 obedient nations to battle. Victory is here crowning Napoleon after his
70 great success in 1810. Fame stands here recording the exploits of the
73 warrior, while conquered cities lie beneath the whole. But it would take
72 more time than I have at command to give anything like a description of
40 this magnificent piece of architecture.
1 
65 That which seems to take most with Peace Friends, is the portion
71 representing an old man taming a bull for agricultural labour; while a
71 young warrior is sheathing his sword, a mother and children sitting at
64 his feet, and Minerva crowned with laurels, stands shedding her
71 protecting influence over them. The erection of this regal monument is
69 wonderful, to hand down to posterity the triumphs of the man whom we
70 first hear of as a student in the military school at Brienne, whom in
71 1784 we see in the Ecole Militaire, founded by Louis XV. in 1751; whom
72 again we find at No. 5, Quai de Court, near Rue de Mail; and in 1794 as
73 a lodger at No. 19, Rue de la Michandère. From this he goes to the Hotel
72 Mirabeau, Rue du Dauphin, where he resided when he defeated his enemies
64 on the 13th Vendimaire. The Hotel de la Colonade, Rue Neuve des
72 Capuchins is his next residence, and where he was married to Josephine.
61 From this hotel he removed to his wife's dwelling in the Rue
72 Chanteriene, No. 52. In 1796 the young general started for Italy, where
71 his conquests paved the way for the ever memorable 18th Brumaire, that
72 made him dictator of France. Napoleon was too great now to be satisfied
72 with private dwellings, and we next trace him to the Elysee, St. Cloud,
72 Versailles, the Tuileries, Fontainbleau, and finally, came his decline,
32 which I need not relate to you.
1 
73 After visiting the Gobelins, passing through its many rooms, seeing here
73 and there a half-finished piece of tapestry; and meeting a number of the
73 members of the late Peace Congress, who, like myself had remained behind
64 to see more of the beauties of the French capital than could be
71 overtaken during the Convention week. I accepted an invitation to dine
73 with a German gentleman at the Palais Royal, and was soon revelling amid
68 the luxuries of the table. I was glad that I had gone to the Palais
72 Royal, for here I had the honour of an introduction to M. Beranger, the
72 poet; and although I had to converse with him through an interpreter, I
72 enjoyed his company very much. "The people's poet," as he is called, is
72 apparently about seventy years of age, bald on the top of the head, and
67 rather corpulent, but of active look, and in the enjoyment of good
71 health. Few writers in France have done better service to the cause of
73 political and religious freedom, than Pierre Jean de Beranger. He is the
70 dauntless friend and advocate of the down-trodden poor and oppressed,
71 and has often incurred the displeasure of the Government by the arrows
67 that he has thrown into their camp. He felt what he wrote; it came
72 straight from his heart, and went directly to the hearts of the people.
69 He expressed himself strongly opposed to slavery, and said, "I don't
73 see how the Americans can reconcile slavery with their professed love of
62 freedom." Dinner out of the way, a walk through the different
72 apartments, and a stroll over the court, and I bade adieu to the Palais
72 Royal, satisfied that I should partake of many worse dinners than I had
27 helped to devour that day.
1 
71 Few nations are more courteous than the French. Here the stranger, let
72 him come from what country he may, and be ever so unacquainted with the
73 people and language, he is sure of a civil reply to any question that he
73 may ask. With the exception of the egregious blunder I have mentioned of
72 the cabman driving me to the Elysee, I was not laughed at once while in
8 France.

71 The sun had just appeared from behind a cloud and was setting, and its
69 reflection upon the domes and spires of the great buildings in Paris
69 made everything appear lovely and sublime, as the train, with almost
69 lightning speed, was bringing me from the French metropolis. I gazed
68 with eager eyes to catch a farewell glance of the tops of the regal
73 palaces through which I had passed, during a stay of fifteen days in the
16 French capital.
1 
70 A pleasant ride of four hours brought us to Boulogne, where we rested
67 for the night. The next morning I was up at an early hour, and out
72 viewing the town. Boulogne could present but little attraction, after a
73 fortnight spent in seeing the lions of Paris. A return to the hotel, and
72 breakfast over, we stepped on board the steamer, and were soon crossing
66 the channel. Two hours more, and I was safely seated in a railway
69 carriage, _en route_ to the English metropolis. We reached London at
66 mid-day, where I was soon comfortably lodged at 22, Cecil Street,
71 Strand. As the London lodging-houses seldom furnish dinners, I lost no
66 time in seeking out a dining-saloon, which I had no difficulty in
66 finding in the Strand. It being the first house of the kind I had
71 entered in London, I was not a little annoyed at the politeness of the
71 waiter. The first salutation I had, after seating myself in one of the
70 stalls, was, "Ox tail, Sir; gravy soup; carrot soup, Sir; roast beef;
69 roast pork; boiled beef; roast lamb; boiled leg of mutton, Sir, with
71 caper sauce; jugged hare, Sir; boiled knuckle of veal and bacon; roast
68 turkey and oyster sauce; sucking pig, Sir; curried chicken; harrico
72 mutton, Sir." These, and many other dishes which I have forgotten, were
70 called over with a rapidity that would have done credit to one of our
71 Yankee pedlars, in crying his wares in a New England village. I was so
69 completely taken by surprise, that I asked for a "bill of fare," and
72 told him to leave me. No city in the world furnishes a cheaper, better,
70 and quicker meal for the weary traveller, than a London eating-house.

71 After spending a day in looking about through this great thoroughfare,
71 the Strand, I sallied forth with letters of introduction, with which I
70 had been provided by my friends before leaving America; and following
71 the direction of one, I was soon at No. 6, A, Waterloo Place. A moment
69 more, and I was in the presence of one of whom I had heard much, and
68 whose name is as familiar to the friends of the slave in the United
72 States, as household words. Although I had never seen him before, yet I
66 felt a feeling akin to love for the man who had proclaimed to the
61 oppressors of my race in America, the doctrine of _immediate
68 emancipation_ for the slaves of the great Republic. On reaching the
72 door, I sent in my letter; and it being fresh from the hands of William
73 Lloyd Garrison, the champion of freedom in the New World, was calculated
73 to insure me a warm reception at the hands of the distinguished M.P. for
72 the Tower Hamlets. Mr. Thompson did not wait for the servant to show me
70 in; but met me at the door himself, and gave me a hearty shake of the
70 hand, at the same time saying, "Welcome to England. How did you leave
73 Garrison." I need not add, that Mr. T. gave me the best advice, as to my
68 course in Great Britain; and how I could best serve the cause of my
69 enslaved countrymen. I never enjoyed three hours more agreeably than
68 those I spent with Mr. T. on the occasion of my first visit. George
73 Thompson's love of freedom, his labours in behalf of the American slave,
71 the negroes of the West Indies, and the wronged millions of India, are
68 too well known to the people of both hemispheres, to need a word of
72 comment from me. With the single exception of the illustrious Garrison,
67 no individual is more loved and honoured by the coloured people of
46 America, and their friends than Mr. Thompson.
1 
69 A few days after my arrival in London, I received an invitation from
73 John Lee, Esq., LL.D., whom I had met at the Peace Congress in Paris, to
73 pay him a visit at his seat, near Aylesbury; and as the time was "fixed"
73 by the Dr., I took the train on the appointed day, on my way to Hartwell
7 House.
1 
72 I had heard much of the aristocracy of England, and must confess that I
68 was not a little prejudiced against them. On a bright sunshine day,
64 between the hours of twelve and two, I found myself seated in a
70 carriage, my back turned upon Aylesbury, the vehicle whirling rapidly
72 over the smooth macadamised road, and I on my first visit to an English
70 gentleman. Twenty minutes' ride, and a turn to the right, and we were
72 amid the fine old trees of Hartwell Park; one having suspended from its
69 branches, the national banners of several different countries; among
73 them, the "Stars and Stripes. I felt glad that my own country's flag had
44 a place there, although Campbell's lines"--
1 
40      "United States, your banner wears,
33       Two emblems,--one of fame;
37       Alas, the other that it bears,
32       Reminds us of your shame.
40       The white man's liberty in types,
37       Stands blazoned by your stars;
46       But what's the meaning of your stripes,
36       They mean your Negro-scars"--
1 
1 
69 were at the time continually running through my mind. Arrived at the
71 door, and we received what every one does who visits Dr. Lee--a hearty
72 welcome. I was immediately shown into a room with a lofty ceiling, hung
73 round with fine specimens of the Italian masters, and told that this was
70 my apartment. Hartwell House stands in an extensive park, shaded with
70 trees, that made me think of the oaks and elms in an American forest,
69 and many of whose limbs had been trimmed and nursed with the best of
65 care. This was for seven years the residence of John Hampden the
69 patriot, and more recently that of Louis XVIII., during his exile in
67 this country. The house is built on a very extensive scale, and is
70 ornamented in the interior with carvings in wood of many of the kings
70 and princes of bygone centuries. A room some 60 feet by 25 contains a
67 variety of articles that the Dr. has collected together--the whole
72 forming a museum that would be considered a sight in the Western States
12 of America.
1 
71 The morning after my arrival at Hartwell I was up at an early hour--in
67 fact, before any of the servants--wandering about through the vast
71 halls, and trying to find my way out, in which I eventually succeeded,
73 but not, however, without aid. It had rained the previous night, and the
70 sun was peeping through a misty cloud as I strolled through the park,
71 listening to the sweet voices of the birds that were fluttering in the
70 tops of the trees, and trimming their wings for a morning flight. The
72 silence of the night had not yet been broken by the voice of man; and I
73 wandered about the vast park unannoyed, except by the dew from the grass
68 that wet my slippers. Not far from the house I came abruptly upon a
67 beautiful little pond of water, where the gold fish were flouncing
72 about, and the gentle ripples glittering in the sunshine looked like so
44 many silver minnows playing on the surface.
1 
70 While strolling about with pleasure, and only regretting that my dear
66 daughters were not with me to enjoy the morning's walk, I saw the
73 gardener on his way to the garden. I followed him, and was soon feasting
69 my eyes upon the richest specimens of garden scenery. There were the
63 peaches hanging upon the trees that were fastened to the wall;
73 vegetables, fruit, and flowers were there in all their bloom and beauty;
69 and even the variegated geranium of a warmer clime, was there in its
71 hothouse home, and seemed to have forgotten that it was in a different
73 country from its own. Dr. Lee shows great taste in the management of his
73 garden. I have seldom seen a more splendid variety of fruits and flowers
65 in the southern States of America, than I saw at Hartwell House.
1 
67 I should, however, state that I was not the only guest at Hartwell
67 during my stay. Dr. Lee had invited several others of the American
65 delegation to the Peace Congress, and two or three of the French
69 delegates who were on a visit to England, were enjoying the Doctor's
70 hospitality. Dr. Lee is a staunch friend of Temperance, as well as of
71 the cause of universal freedom. Every year he treats his tenantry to a
66 dinner, and I need not add that these are always conducted on the
31 principle of total abstinence.
1 
69 During the second day we visited several of the cottages of the work
73 people, and in these I took no little interest. The people of the United
70 States know nothing of the real condition of the labouring classes of
73 England. The peasants of Great Britain are always spoken of as belonging
70 to the soil. I was taught in America that the English labourer was no
69 better off than the slave upon a Carolina rice-field. I had seen the
73 slaves in Missouri huddled together, three, four, and even five families
71 in a single room not more than 15 by 25 feet square, and I expected to
72 see the same in England. But in this I was disappointed. After visiting
69 a new house that the Doctor was building, he took us into one of the
66 cottages that stood near the road, and gave us an opportunity, of
71 seeing, for the first time, an English peasant's cot. We entered a low
72 whitewashed room, with a stone floor that showed an admirable degree of
73 cleanness. Before us was a row of shelves filled with earthen dishes and
71 pewter spoons, glittering as if they had just come from under the hand
72 of a woman of taste. A Cobden loaf of bread, that had just been left by
71 the baker's boy, lay upon an oaken table which had been much worn away
73 with the scrubbing brush; while just above lay the old family bible that
66 had been handed down from father to son, until its possession was
71 considered of almost as great value as its contents. A half-open door,
71 leading into another room, showed us a clean bed; the whole presenting
63 as fine a picture of neatness, order, and comfort, as the most
65 fastidious taste could wish to see. No occupant was present, and
70 therefore I inspected everything with a greater degree of freedom. In
71 front of the cottage was a small grass plot, with here and there a bed
72 of flowers, cheated out of its share of sunshine by the tall holly that
72 had been planted near it. As I looked upon the home of the labourer, my
73 thoughts were with my enslaved countrymen. What a difference, thought I,
71 there is between the tillers of the soil in England and America. There
66 could not be a more complete refutation of the assertion that the
68 English labourer is no better off than the American slave, than the
69 scenes that were then before me. I called the attention of one of my
72 American friends to a beautiful rose near the door of the cot, and said
67 to him, "The law that will protect that flower will also guard and
72 protect the hand that planted it." He knew that I had drank deep of the
73 cup of slavery, was aware of what I meant, and merely nodded his head in
66 reply. I never experienced hospitality more genuine, and yet more
66 unpretending, than was meted out to me while at Hartwell. And the
64 favourable impression made on my own mind, of the distinguished
71 proprietor of Hartwell Park, was nearly as indelible as my humble name
66 that the Doctor had engraven in a brick, in the vault beneath the
31 Observatory in Hartwell House.
1 
69 On my return to London I accepted an invitation to join a party on a
69 visit to Windsor Castle; and taking the train at the Waterloo Bridge
70 Station, we were soon passing through a pleasant part of the country.
68 Arrived at the castle, we committed ourselves into the hands of the
67 servants, and were introduced into Her Majesty's State apartments,
70 Audience Chamber, Vandyck Room, Waterloo Chambers, St. George's Hall,
72 Gold Pantry, and many others whose names I have forgotten. In wandering
72 about the different apartments I lost my company, and in trying to find
68 them, passed through a room in which hung a magnificent portrait of
71 Charles I., by Vandyck. The hum and noise of my companions had ceased,
68 and I had the scene and silence to myself. I looked in vain for the
68 king's evil genius (Cromwell), but he was not in the same room. The
69 pencil of Sir Peter Lely has left a splendid full-length likeness of
72 James II. George IV. is suspended from a peg in the wall, looking as if
66 it was fresh from the hands of Sir Thomas Lawrence, its admirable
72 painter. I was now in St. George's Hall, and I gazed upward to view the
73 beautiful figures on the ceiling, until my neck was nearly out of joint.
71 Leaving this room, I inspected with interest the ancient _keep_ of the
72 castle. In past centuries this part of the palace was used as a prison.
70 Here James the First of Scotland was detained a prisoner for eighteen
68 years. I viewed the window through which the young prince had often
64 looked to catch a glimpse of the young and beautiful Lady Jane,
62 daughter of the Earl of Somerset, with whom he was enamoured.
1 
69 From the top of the Round Tower I had a fine view of the surrounding
73 country. Stoke Park, once the residence of that great friend of humanity
72 and civilization, William Penn, was among the scenes that I viewed with
66 pleasure from Windsor Castle. Four years ago, when in the city of
73 Philadelphia, and hunting up the places associated with the name of this
69 distinguished man, and more recently when walking over the farm once
69 occupied by him on the banks of the Delaware, examining the old malt
71 house which is now left standing, because of the veneration with which
70 the name of the man who built it is held, I had no idea that I should
73 ever see the dwelling which he had occupied in the Old World. Stoke Park
69 is about four miles from Windsor, and is now owned by the Right Hon.
18 Henry Labouchere.
1 
68 The castle, standing as it does on an eminence, and surrounded by a
69 beautiful valley covered with splendid villas, has the appearance of
66 Gulliver looking down upon the Lilliputians. It rears its massive
72 towers and irregular walls over and above every other object; it stands
71 like a mountain in the desert. How full this old palace is of material
65 for thought! How one could ramble here alone, or with one or two
72 congenial companions, and enjoy a recapitulation of its history! But an
73 engagement to be at Croydon in the evening cut short my stay at Windsor,
59 and compelled me to return to town in advance of my party.
1 
41        *       *       *       *       *
1 
73 Having met with John Morland, Esq., of Heath Lodge, at Paris, he gave me
66 an invitation to visit Croydon, and deliver a lecture on American
70 Slavery; and last evening, at eight o'clock, I found myself in a fine
71 old building in the town, and facing the first English audience that I
71 had seen in the sea-girt isle. It was my first welcome in England. The
64 assembly was an enthusiastic one, and made still more so by the
72 appearance of George Thompson, Esq., M.P., upon the platform. It is not
73 my intention to give accounts of my lectures or meetings in these pages.
70 I therefore merely say, that I left Croydon with a good impression of
70 the English, and Heath Lodge with a feeling that its occupant was one
31 of the most benevolent of men.
1 
73 The same party with whom I visited Windsor being supplied with a card of
72 admission to the Bank of England, I accepted an invitation to be one of
66 the company. We entered the vast building at a little past twelve
69 o'clock to-day. The sun threw into the large halls a brilliancy that
70 seemed to light up the countenances of the almost countless number of
72 clerks, who were at their desks, or serving persons at the counters. As
69 nearly all my countrymen who visit London pay their respects to this
68 noted institution, I shall sum up my visit to it, by saying that it
71 surpassed my highest idea of a bank. But a stroll through this monster
73 building of gold and silver brought to my mind an incident that occurred
43 to me a year after my escape from slavery.
1 
72 In the autumn of 1835, having been cheated out of the previous summer's
69 earnings, by the captain of the steamer in which I had been employed
67 running away with the money, I was, like the rest of the men, left
69 without any means of support during the winter, and therefore had to
65 seek employment in the neighbouring towns. I went to the town of
72 Monroe, in the state of Michigan, and while going through the principal
70 streets looking for work, I passed the door of the only barber in the
66 town, whose shop appeared to be filled with persons waiting to be
71 shaved. As there was but one man at work, and as I had, while employed
70 in the steamer, occasionally shaved a gentleman who could not perform
72 that office himself, it occurred to me that I might get employment here
73 as a journeyman barber. I therefore made immediate application for work,
71 but the barber told me he did not need a hand. But I was not to be put
72 off so easily, and after making several offers to work cheap, I frankly
73 told him, that if he would not employ me I would get a room near to him,
70 and set up an opposition establishment. This threat, however, made no
72 impression on the barber; and as I was leaving, one of the men who were
68 waiting to be shaved said, "If you want a room in which to commence
67 business, I have one on the opposite side of the street." This man
69 followed me out; we went over, and I looked at the room. He strongly
62 urged me to set up, at the same time promising to give me his
70 influence. I took the room, purchased an old table, two chairs, got a
72 pole with a red stripe painted around it, and the next day opened, with
71 a sign over the door, "Fashionable Hair-dresser from New York, Emperor
73 of the West." I need not add that my enterprise was very annoying to the
71 "shop over the way"--especially my sign, which happened to be the most
72 expensive part of the concern. Of course, I had to tell all who came in
71 that my neighbour on the opposite side did not keep clean towels, that
71 his razors were dull, and, above all, he had never been to New York to
65 see the fashions. Neither had I. In a few weeks I had the entire
69 business of the town, to the great discomfiture of the other barber.
1 
64 At this time, money matters in the Western States were in a sad
66 condition. Any person who could raise a small amount of money was
73 permitted to establish a bank, and allowed to issue notes for four times
72 the sum raised. This being the case, many persons borrowed money merely
70 long enough to exhibit to the bank inspectors, and the borrowed money
68 was returned, and the bank left without a dollar in its vaults, if,
70 indeed, it had a vault about its premises. The result was, that banks
71 were started all over the Western States, and the country flooded with
71 worthless paper. These were known as the "Wild Cat Banks." Silver coin
72 being very scarce, and the banks not being allowed to issue notes for a
72 smaller amount than one dollar, several persons put out notes from 6 to
73 75 cents in value; these were called "Shinplasters." The Shinplaster was
72 in the shape of a promissory note, made payable on demand. I have often
73 seen persons with large rolls of these bills, the whole not amounting to
72 more than five dollars. Some weeks after I had commenced business on my
68 "own hook," I was one evening very much crowded with customers; and
72 while they were talking over the events of the day, one of them said to
73 me, "Emperor, you seem to be doing a thriving business. You should do as
73 other business men, issue your Shinplasters." This, of course, as it was
70 intended, created a laugh; but with me it was no laughing matter, for
68 from that moment I began to think seriously of becoming a banker. I
71 accordingly went a few days after to a printer, and he, wishing to get
70 the job of printing, urged me to put out my notes, and showed me some
72 specimens of engravings that he had just received from Detroit. My head
66 being already filled with the idea of a bank, I needed but little
70 persuasion to set the thing finally afloat. Before I left the printer
68 the notes were partly in type, and I studying how I should keep the
67 public from counterfeiting them. The next day my Shinplasters were
69 handed to me, the whole amount being twenty dollars, and after being
71 duly signed were ready for circulation. At first my notes did not take
71 well; they were too new, and viewed with a suspicious eye. But through
70 the assistance of my customers, and a good deal of exertion on my own
66 part, my bills were soon in circulation; and nearly all the money
71 received in return for my notes was spent in fitting up and decorating
9 my shop.
1 
73 Few bankers get through this world without their difficulties, and I was
68 not to be an exception. A short time after my money had been out, a
69 party of young men, either wishing to pull down my vanity, or to try
63 the soundness of my bank, determined to give it "a run." After
69 collecting together a number of my bills, they came one at a time to
70 demand other money for them, and I, not being aware of what was going
65 on, was taken by surprise. One day as I was sitting at my table,
63 strapping some new razors I had just got with the avails of my
68 "Shinplasters," one of the men entered and said, "Emperor, you will
66 oblige me if you will give me some other money for these notes of
70 yours." I immediately cashed the notes with the most worthless of the
70 Wild Cat money that I had on hand, but which was a lawful tender. The
66 young man had scarcely left when a second appeared with a similar
71 amount, and demanded payment. These were cashed, and soon a third came
72 with his roll of notes. I paid these with an air of triumph, although I
73 had but half a dollar left. I began now to think seriously what I should
71 do, or how to act, provided another demand should be made. While I was
72 thus engaged in thought, I saw the fourth man crossing the street, with
72 a handful of notes, evidently my "Shinplasters." I instantaneously shut
71 the door, and looking out of the window, said, "I have closed business
71 for the day: come to-morrow and I will see you." In looking across the
72 street, I saw my rival standing in his shop-door, grinning and clapping
71 his hands at my apparent downfall. I was completely "done _Brown_" for
73 the day. However, I was not to be "used up" in this way; so I escaped by
71 the back door, and went in search of my friend who had first suggested
73 to me the idea of issuing notes. I found him, told him of the difficulty
71 I was in, and wished him to point out a way by which I might extricate
73 myself. He laughed heartily, and then said, "You must act as all bankers
71 do in this part of the country." I inquired how they did, and he said,
73 "When your notes are brought to you, you must redeem them, and then send
69 them out and get other money for them; and, with the latter, you can
72 keep cashing your own Shinplasters." This was indeed a new job to me. I
72 immediately commenced putting in circulation the notes which I had just
72 redeemed, and my efforts were crowned with so much success, that before
71 I slept that night my "Shinplasters" were again in circulation, and my
33 bank once more on a sound basis.
1 
72 As I saw the clerks shovelling out the yellow coin upon the counters of
71 the Bank of England, and men coming in and going out with weighty bags
73 of the precious metal in their hands, or on their shoulders, I could not
72 but think of the great contrast between the monster Institution, within
68 whose walls I was then standing, and the Wild Cat Banks of America!

11 LETTER IX.
1 
71 _The British Museum--A Portrait--Night Reading--A Dark Day--A Fugitive
64 Slave on the Streets of London,--A Friend in the time of need._
1 
1 
40                     LONDON, _Sept. 24_.
1 
72 I have devoted the past ten days to sight-seeing in the Metropolis--the
71 first two of which were spent in the British Museum. After procuring a
71 guide-book at the door as I entered, I seated myself on the first seat
73 that caught my eye, arranged as well as I could in my mind the different
72 rooms, and then commenced in good earnest. The first part I visited was
69 the Gallery of Antiquities, through to the north gallery, and thence
66 to the Lycian Room. This place is filled with tombs, bas-reliefs,
67 statues, and other productions of the same art. Venus, seated, and
68 smelling a lotus flower which she held in her hand, and attended by
72 three graces, put a stop to the rapid strides that I was making through
63 this part of the hall. This is really one of the most precious
69 productions of the art that I have ever seen. Many of the figures in
69 this room are very much mutilated, yet one can linger here for hours
72 with interest. A good number of the statues are of uncertain date; they
62 are of great value as works of art, and more so as a means of
66 enlightening much that has been obscure with respect to Lycia, an
46 ancient and celebrated country of Asia Minor.
1 
71 In passing through the eastern Zoological Gallery, I was surrounded on
71 every side by an army of portraits suspended upon the walls; and among
67 these was the Protector. The people of one century kicks his bones
72 through the streets of London, another puts his portrait in the British
65 Museum, and a future generation may possibly give him a place in
67 Westminster Abbey. Such is the uncertainty of the human character.
72 Yesterday, a common soldier--to-day, the ruler of an empire--to-morrow,
69 suspended upon the gallows. In an adjoining room I saw a portrait of
71 Baxter, which gives one a pretty good idea of the great Nonconformist.
73 In the same room hung a splendid modern portrait, without any intimation
72 in the guide-book of who it represented, or when it was painted. It was
72 so much like one whom I had seen, and on whom my affections were placed
70 in my younger days, that I obtained a seat from an adjoining room and
72 rested myself before it. After sitting half an hour or more, I wandered
71 to another part of the building, but only to return again to my "first
66 love," where I remained till the throng had disappeared one after
65 another, and the officer reminding me that it was time to close.
1 
72 It was eight o'clock before I reached my lodgings. Although fatigued by
71 the day's exertions, I again resumed the reading of Roscoe's "Leo X.,"
67 and had nearly finished seventy-three pages, when the clock on St.
73 Martin's Church apprised me that it was two. He who escapes from slavery
72 at the age of twenty years, without any education, as did the writer of
73 this letter, must read when others are asleep, if he would catch up with
68 the rest of the world. "To be wise," says Pope, "is but to know how
69 little can be known." The true searcher after truth and knowledge is
69 always like a child; although gaining strength from year to year, he
66 still "learns to labour and to wait." The field of labour is ever
67 expanding before him, reminding him that he has yet more to learn;
68 teaching him that he is nothing more than a child in knowledge, and
68 inviting him onward with a thousand varied charms. The son may take
69 possession of the father's goods at his death, but he cannot inherit
66 with the property the father's cultivated mind. He may put on the
67 father's old coat, but that is all: the immortal mind of the first
29 wearer has gone to the tomb.
1 
67 Property may be bequeathed, but knowledge cannot. Then let him who
68 would be useful in his day and generation be up and doing. Like the
68 Chinese student who learned perseverance from the woman whom he saw
73 trying to rub a crow-bar into a needle, so should we take the experience
65 of the past to lighten our feet through the paths of the future.
1 
72 The next morning at ten, I was again at the door of the great building;
66 was soon within its walls seeing what time would not allow of the
73 previous day. I spent some hours in looking through glass cases, viewing
73 specimens of minerals, such as can scarcely be found in any place out of
70 the British Museum. During this day I did not fail to visit the great
73 Library. It is a spacious room, surrounded with large glass cases filled
70 with volumes, whose very look tells you that they are of age. Around,
63 under the cornice, were arranged a number of old black-looking
70 portraits, in all probability the authors of some of the works in the
73 glass cases beneath. About the room were placed long tables, with stands
70 for reading and writing, and around these were a number of men busily
69 engaged in looking over some chosen author. Old men with grey hairs,
71 young men with mustaches--some in cloth, others in fustian, indicating
71 that men of different rank can meet here. Not a single word was spoken
64 during my stay, all appearing to enjoy the silence that reigned
71 throughout the great room. This is indeed a retreat from the world. No
68 one inquires who the man is who is at his side, and each pursues in
72 silence his own researches. The racing of pens over the sheets of paper
54 was all that disturbed the stillness of the occasion.
1 
72 From the Library I strolled to other rooms, and feasted my eyes on what
72 I had never before seen. He who goes over this immense building, cannot
67 do so without a feeling of admiration for the men whose energy has
72 brought together this vast and wonderful collection of things, the like
63 of which cannot be found in any other museum in the world. The
73 reflection of the setting sun against a mirror in one of the rooms, told
71 me that night was approaching, and I had but a moment in which to take
72 another look at the portrait that I had seen the previous day, and then
26 bade adieu to the Museum.
1 
71 Having published the narrative of my life and escape from slavery, and
68 put it into the booksellers' hands--and seeing a prospect of a fair
71 sale, I ventured to take from my purse the last sovereign to make up a
73 small sum to remit to the United States, for the support of my daughter,
63 who is at school there. Before doing this, however, I had made
69 arrangements to attend a public meeting in the city of Worcester, at
69 which the mayor was to preside. Being informed by the friends of the
71 slave there, that I would, in all probability, sell a number of copies
66 of my book, and being told that Worcester was only ten miles from
69 London, I felt safe in parting with all but a few shillings, feeling
73 sure that my purse would soon be again replenished. But you may guess my
70 surprise when I learned that Worcester was above a hundred miles from
71 London, and that I had not retained money enough to defray my expenses
72 to the place. In my haste and wish to make up the ten pounds to send to
71 my children, I had forgotten that the payment for my lodgings would be
70 demanded before I should leave town. Saturday morning came; I paid my
69 lodging bill, and had three shillings and fourpence left; and out of
73 this sum I was to get three dinners, as I was only served with breakfast
68 and tea at my lodgings. Nowhere in the British empire do the people
73 witness as dark days as in London. It was on Monday morning, in the fore
71 part of October, as the clock on St. Martin's Church was striking ten,
70 that I left my lodgings, and turned into the Strand. The street lamps
72 were yet burning, and the shops were all lighted as if day had not made
70 its appearance. This great thoroughfare, as usual at this time of the
63 day, was thronged with business men going their way, and women
73 sauntering about for pleasure or for the want of something better to do.
73 I passed down the Strand to Charing Cross, and looked in vain to see the
72 majestic statue of Nelson upon the top of the great shaft. The clock on
68 St. Martin's Church struck eleven, but my sight could not penetrate
70 through the dark veil that hung between its face and me. In fact, day
73 had been completely turned into night; and the brilliant lights from the
68 shop windows almost persuaded me that another day had not appeared.
71 Turning, I retraced my steps, and was soon passing through the massive
73 gates of Temple Bar, wending my way to the city, when a beggar boy at my
71 heels accosted me for a half-penny to buy bread. I had scarcely served
71 the boy, when I observed near by, and standing close to a lamp post, a
70 coloured man, and from his general appearance I was satisfied that he
68 was an American. He eyed me attentively as I passed him, and seemed
71 anxious to speak. When I had got some distance from him I looked back,
73 and his eyes were still upon me. No longer able to resist the temptation
69 to speak with him, I returned, and commencing conversation with him,
72 learned a little of his history, which was as follows. He had, he said,
72 escaped from slavery in Maryland, and reached New York; but not feeling
72 himself secure there, he had, through the kindness of the captain of an
67 English ship, made his way to Liverpool; and not being able to get
68 employment there, he had come up to London. Here he had met with no
72 better success; and having been employed in the growing of tobacco, and
68 being unaccustomed to any other work, he could not get to labour in
72 England. I told him he had better try to get to the West Indies; but he
71 informed me that he had not a single penny, and that he had nothing to
72 eat that day. By this man's story, I was moved to tears; and going to a
70 neighbouring shop, I took from my purse my last shilling, changed it,
70 and gave this poor brother fugitive one-half. The poor man burst into
73 tears as I placed the sixpence in his hand, and said--"You are the first
71 friend I have met in London." I bade him farewell, and left him with a
73 feeling of regret that I could not place him beyond the reach of want. I
72 went on my way to the city, and while going through Cheapside, a streak
73 of light appeared in the east that reminded me that it was not night. In
71 vain I wandered from street to street, with the hope that I might meet
72 some one who would lend me money enough to get to Worcester. Hungry and
68 fatigued I was returning to my lodgings, when the great clock of St
69 Paul's Church, under whose shadow I was then passing, struck four. A
70 stroll through Fleet Street and the Strand, and I was again pacing my
70 room. On my return, I found a letter from Worcester had arrived in my
71 absence, informing me that a party of gentlemen would meet me the next
70 day on my reaching that place; and saying, "Bring plenty of books, as
68 you will doubtless sell a large number." The last sixpence had been
69 spent for postage stamps, in order to send off some letters to other
70 places, and I could not even stamp a letter in answer to the one last
73 from Worcester. The only vestige of money about me was a smooth farthing
70 that a little girl had given to me at the meeting at Croydon, saying,
73 "This is for the slaves." I was three thousand miles from home, with but
70 a single farthing in my pocket! Where on earth is a man without money
69 more destitute? The cold hills of the Arctic regions have not a more
66 inhospitable appearance than London to the stranger with an empty
72 pocket. But whilst I felt depressed at being in such a sad condition, I
72 was conscious that I had done right in remitting the last ten pounds to
70 America. It was for the support of those whom God had committed to my
71 care, and whom I love as I can no others. I had no friend in London to
71 whom I could apply for temporary aid. My friend, Mr. Thompson, was out
66 of town, and I did not know his address. The dark day was rapidly
71 passing away--the clock in the hall had struck six. I had given up all
73 hopes of reaching Worcester the next day, and had just rung the bell for
68 the servant to bring me some tea, when a gentle tap at the door was
71 heard--the servant entered, and informed me that a gentleman below was
73 wishing to see me. I bade her fetch a light and ask him up. The stranger
71 was my young friend Frederick Stevenson, son of the excellent minister
69 of the Borough Road Chapel. I had lectured in this chapel a few days
69 previous; and this young gentleman, with more than ordinary zeal and
71 enthusiasm for the cause of bleeding humanity, and respect for me, had
73 gone amongst his father's congregation and sold a number of copies of my
71 book, and had come to bring me the money. I wiped the silent tear from
71 my eyes as the young man placed the thirteen half-crowns in my hand. I
65 did not let him know under what obligation I was to him for this
72 disinterested act of kindness. He does not know to this day what aid he
71 has rendered to a stranger in a strange land, and I feel that I am but
69 discharging in a trifling degree, my debt of gratitude to this young
72 gentleman, in acknowledging my obligation to him. As the man who called
73 for bread and cheese, when feeling in his pocket for the last threepence
69 to pay for it, found a sovereign that he was not aware he possessed,
72 countermanded the order for the lunch, and bade them bring him the best
71 dinner they could get; so I told the servant when she brought the tea,
73 that I had changed my mind, and should go out to dine. With the means in
70 my pocket of reaching Worcester the next day, I sat down to dinner at
69 the Adelphi with a good cut of roast beef before me, and felt myself
52 once more at home. Thus ended a dark day in London.

42                     LONDON, _October 10_.
1 
73 For some days past, Sol has not shown his face, clouds have obscured the
72 sky, and the rain has fallen in torrents, which has contributed much to
68 the general gloom. However, I have spent the time in as agreeable a
73 manner as I well could. Yesterday I fulfilled an engagement to dine with
70 a gentleman at the Whittington Club. One who is unacquainted with the
62 Club system as carried on in London, can scarcely imagine the
71 conveniences they present. Every member appears to be at home, and all
73 seem to own a share in the Club. There is a free-and-easy way with those
69 who frequent Clubs, and a licence given there that is unknown in the
73 drawing-room of the private mansion. I met the gentleman at the Club, at
67 the appointed hour, and after his writing my name in the visitors'
66 book, we proceeded to the dining-room, where we partook of a good
8 dinner.
1 
71 We had been in the room but a short time, when a small man, dressed in
70 black, with his coat buttoned up to the chin, entered the saloon, and
73 took a seat at the table hard by. My friend in a low whisper informed me
71 that this person was one of the French refugees. He was apparently not
72 more than thirty years of age, and exceedingly good looking--his person
72 being slight, his feet and hands very small and well shaped, especially
73 his hands, which were covered with kid gloves, so tightly drawn on, that
71 the points of the finger nails were visible through them. His face was
72 mild and almost womanly in its beauty, his eyes soft and full, his brow
72 open and ample, his features well defined, and approaching to the ideal
72 Greek in contour; the lines about his mouth were exquisitely sweet, and
72 yet resolute in expression; his hair was short--his having no mustaches
68 gave him nothing of the look of a Frenchman; and I was not a little
69 surprised when informed that the person before me was Louis Blanc. I
72 could scarcely be persuaded to believe that one so small, so child-like
69 in stature, had taken a prominent part in the Revolution of 1848. He
70 held in his hand a copy of _La Presse_, and as soon as he was seated,
70 opened it and began to devour its contents. The gentleman with whom I
71 was dining was not acquainted with him, but at the close of our dinner
58 he procured me an introduction through another gentleman.
1 
71 As we were returning to our lodgings, we saw in Exeter Street, Strand,
71 one of those exhibitions that can be seen in almost any of the streets
73 in the suburbs of the Metropolis, but which is something of a novelty to
69 those from the other side of the Atlantic. This was an exhibition of
71 "Punch and Judy." Everything was in full operation when we reached the
73 spot. A puppet appeared eight or ten inches from the waist upwards, with
69 an enormous face, huge nose, mouth widely grinning, projecting chin,
69 cheeks covered with grog blossoms, a large protuberance on his back,
72 another on his chest; yet with these deformities he appeared uncommonly
66 happy. This was Mr. Punch. He held in his right hand a tremendous
72 bludgeon, with which he amused himself by rapping on the head every one
70 who came within his reach. This exhibition seems very absurd, yet not
70 less than one hundred were present--children, boys, old men, and even
70 gentlemen and ladies, were standing by, and occasionally greeting the
72 performer with the smile of approbation. Mr. Punch, however, was not to
67 have it all his own way, for another and better sort of Punch-like
64 exhibition appeared a few yards off, that took away Mr. Punch's
70 audience, to the great dissatisfaction of that gentleman. This was an
72 exhibition called the Fantoccini, and far superior to any of the street
69 performances which I have yet seen. The curtain rose and displayed a
71 beautiful theatre in miniature, and most gorgeously painted. The organ
72 which accompanied it struck up a hornpipe, and a sailor, dressed in his
69 blue jacket, made his appearance and commenced keeping time with the
71 utmost correctness. This figure was not so long as Mr. Punch, but much
70 better looking. At the close of the hornpipe the little sailor made a
66 bow, and tripped off, apparently conscious of having deserved the
70 undivided applause of the bystanders. The curtain dropped; but in two
73 or three minutes it was again up, and a rope was discovered, extended on
71 two cross pieces, for dancing upon. The tune was changed to an air, in
71 which the time was marked, a graceful figure appeared, jumped upon the
67 rope with its balance pole, and displayed all the manoeuvres of an
72 expert performer on the tight rope. Many who would turn away in disgust
73 from Mr. Punch, will stand for hours and look at the performances of the
67 Fantoccini. If people, like the Vicar of Wakefield, will sometimes
70 "allow themselves to be happy," they can hardly fail to have a hearty
67 laugh at the drolleries of the Fantoccini. There may be degrees of
69 absurdity in the manner of wasting our time, but there is an evident
72 affectation in decrying these humble and innocent exhibitions, by those
72 who will sit till two or three in the morning to witness a pantomime at
17 a theatre-royal.

73 An autumn sun shone brightly through a remarkably transparent atmosphere
72 this morning, which was a most striking contrast to the weather we have
71 had during the past three days; and I again set out to see some of the
72 lions of the city, commencing with the Tower of London. Every American,
70 on returning home from a visit to the old world, speaks with pride of
71 the places he saw while in Europe; and of the many resorts of interest
72 he has read of, few have made a more lasting impression upon his memory
71 than the Tower of London. The stories of the imprisoning of kings, and
66 queens, the murdering of princes, the torturing of men and women,
71 without regard to birth, education, or station, and of the burning and
73 rebuilding of the old pile, have all sunk deep into his heart. A walk of
72 twenty minutes, after being set down at the Bank by an omnibus, brought
68 me to the gate of the Tower. A party of friends who were to meet me
73 there had not arrived, so I had an opportunity of inspecting the grounds
65 and taking a good view of the external appearance of the old and
72 celebrated building. The Tower is surrounded by a high wall, and around
72 this a deep ditch partly filled with stagnated water. The wall incloses
69 twelve acres of ground on which stand the several towers, occupying,
72 with their walks and avenues, the whole space. The most ancient part of
71 the building is called the "White Tower," so as to distinguish it from
63 the parts more recently built. Its walls are seventeen feet in
72 thickness, and ninety-two in height, exclusive of the turrets, of which
69 there are four. My company arrived, and we entered the tower through
71 four massive gates, the innermost one being pointed out as the "Water,
73 or Traitors' Gate"--so called from the fact that it opened to the river,
72 and through it the criminals were usually brought to the prison within.
72 But this passage is now closed up. We visited the various apartments in
73 the old building. The room in the Bloody Tower, where the infant princes
73 were put to death by the command of their uncle, Richard III.; also, the
65 recess behind the gate where the bones of the young princes were
68 concealed, were shown to us. The warden of the prison who showed us
72 through, seemed to have little or no veneration for Henry VIII.; for he
72 often cracked a joke, or told a story at the expense of the murderer of
72 Anne Boleyn. The old man wiped the tear from his eye, as he pointed out
72 the grave of Lady Jane Grey. This was doubtless one of the best as well
68 as most innocent of those who lost their lives in the Tower; young,
71 virtuous, and handsome, she became a victim to the ambition of her own
71 and her husband's relations. I tried to count the names on the wall in
65 "Beauchamp's Tower," but they were too numerous. Anne Boleyn was
73 imprisoned here. The room in the "Brick Tower," where Lady Jane Grey was
71 imprisoned, was pointed out as a place of interest. We were next shown
71 into the "White Tower." We passed through a long room filled with many
63 things having a warlike appearance; and among them a number of
64 equestrian figures, as large as life, and clothed in armour and
69 trappings of the various reigns from Edward I. to James II., or from
69 1272 to 1685. Elizabeth, or the "Maiden Queen," as the warden called
69 her, was the most imposing of the group; she was on a cream coloured
66 charger. We left the Maiden Queen to examine the cloak upon which
70 General Wolf died, at the storming of Quebec. In this room Sir Walter
65 Raleigh was imprisoned, and here was written his "History of the
70 World." In his own hand, upon the wall, is written, "Be thou faithful
70 unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." His Bible is still
72 shown, with these memorable lines written in it by himself a short time
20 before his death:--
1 
43    "Even such is Time that takes on trust,
41     Our youth, our joy, our all we have,
39     And pays us but with age and dust;
38     Who in the dark and silent grave,
40     When we have wandered all our ways,
37     Shuts up the story of our days."
1 
1 
72 Spears, battle-axes, pikes, helmets, targets, bows and arrows, and many
72 instruments of torture, whose names I did not learn, grace the walls of
69 this room. The block on which the Earl of Essex and Anne Boleyn were
67 beheaded, was shown among other objects of interest. A view of the
70 "Queen's Jewels" closed our visit to the Tower. The Gold Staff of St.
71 Edward, and the Baptismal Font used at the Royal christenings, made of
71 solid silver, and more than four feet high, were among the jewels here
70 exhibited. The Sword of Justice was there, as if to watch the rest of
68 the valuables. However, this was not the sword that Peter used. Our
65 acquaintance with De Foe, Sir Walter Raleigh, Chaucer, and James
73 Montgomery, through their writings, and the knowledge that they had been
72 incarcerated within the walls of the bastile that we were just leaving,
67 caused us to look back again and again upon its dark grey turrets.
1 
72 I closed the day with a look at the interior of St. Paul's Cathedral. A
71 service was just over, and we met a crowd coming out as we entered the
70 great building. "Service is over, and two pence for all that wants to
69 stay," was the first sound that caught our ears. In the Burlesque of
72 "Esmeralda," a man is met in the belfry of the Notre Dame at Paris, and
52 being asked for money by one of the vergers says:--
1 
36    "I paid three pence at the door,
43     And since I came in a great deal more:
46     Upon my honour you have emptied my purse,
46     St. Paul's Cathedral could not do worse."
1 
1 
70 I felt inclined to join in this sentiment before I left the church. A
68 fine statue of "Surly Sam" Johnson was one of the first things that
69 caught our eyes on looking around. A statue of Sir Edward Packenham,
71 who fell at the Battle of New Orleans, was on the opposite side of the
73 great hall. As we had walked over the ground where this General fell, we
71 viewed his statue with more than ordinary interest. We were taken from
66 one scene of interest to another, until we found ourselves in the
66 "Whispering Gallery." From the dome we had a splendid view of the
69 Metropolis of the world. A scaffold was erected up here to enable an
73 artist to take sketches from which a panorama of London was painted. The
69 artist was three years at work. The painting is now exhibited at the
71 Colosseum; but the brain of the artist was turned, and he died insane!
68 Indeed, one can scarcely conceive how it could be otherwise. You in
70 America have no idea of the immensity of this building. Pile together
73 half-a-dozen of the largest churches in New York or Boston, and you will
57 have but a faint representation of St. Paul's Cathedral.

1 
68 I have just returned from a stroll of two hours through Westminster
66 Abbey. We entered the building at a door near Poets' Corner, and,
67 naturally enough, looked around for the monuments of the men whose
66 imaginative powers have contributed so much to instruct and amuse
73 mankind. I was not a little disappointed in the few I saw. In almost any
72 church-yard you may see monuments and tombs far superior to anything in
70 the Poets' Corner. A few only have monuments. Shakspere, who wrote of
66 man to man, and for man to the end of time, is honoured with one.
70 Addison's monument is also there; but the greater number have nothing
71 more erected to their memories than busts or medallions. Poets' Corner
71 is not splendid in appearance, yet I observed visiters lingering about
69 it, as if they were tied to the spot by love and veneration for some
69 departed friend. All seemed to regard it as classic ground. No sound
73 louder than a whisper was heard during the whole time, except the verger
65 treading over the marble floor with a light step. There is great
65 pleasure in sauntering about the tombs of those with whom we are
73 familiar through their writings; and we tear ourselves from their ashes,
66 as we would from those of a bosom friend. The genius of these men
73 spreads itself over the whole panorama of Nature, giving us one vast and
73 varied picture, the colour of which will endure to the end of time. None
72 can portray like the poet the passions of the human soul. The statue of
71 Addison, clad in his dressing-gown, is not far from that of Shakspere.
71 He looks as if he had just left the study, after finishing some chosen
72 paper for the _Spectator_. This memento of a great man, was the work of
71 the British public. Such a mark of national respect was but justice to
73 one who has contributed more to purify and raise the standard of English
70 literature, than any man of his day. We next visited the other end of
72 the same transept, near the northern door. Here lie Mansfield, Chatham,
68 Fox, the second William Pitt, Grattan, Wilberforce, and a few other
66 statesmen. But, above all, is the stately monument to the Earl of
72 Chatham. In no other place so small, do so many great men lie together.
73 To these men, whose graves strangers from all parts of the world wish to
71 view, the British public are in a great measure indebted for England's
66 fame. The high pre-eminence which England has so long enjoyed and
69 maintained in the scale of empire, has constantly been the boast and
73 pride of the English people. The warm panegyrics that have been lavished
66 on her constitution and laws--the songs chaunted to celebrate her
73 glory--the lustre of her arms, as the glowing theme of her warriors--the
68 thunder of her artillery in proclaiming her moral prowess, her flag
68 being unfurled to every breeze and ocean, rolling to her shores the
72 tribute of a thousand realms--show England to be the greatest nation in
68 the world, and speak volumes for the great departed, as well as for
72 those of the living present. One requires no company, no amusements, no
71 books in such a place as this. Time and death have placed within those
69 walls sufficient to occupy the mind, if one should stay here a week.
1 
71 On my return, I spent an hour very pleasantly in the National Academy,
73 in the same building as the National Gallery. Many of the paintings here
73 are of a fine order. Oliver Cromwell looking upon the headless corpse of
71 King Charles I., appeared to draw the greatest number of spectators. A
73 scene from "As You Like it," was one of the best executed pieces we saw.
72 This was "Rosalind, Celia, and Orlando." The artist did himself and the
72 subject great credit. Kemble, in Hamlet, with that ever memorable skull
66 in his hand, was one of the pieces which we viewed with no little
69 interest. It is strange that Hamlet is always represented as a thin,
70 lean man, when the Hamlet of Shakspere was a fat, John Bull-kind of a
73 man. But the best piece in the Gallery was "Dante meditating the episode
69 of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta, S'Inferno, Canto V." Our
70 first interest for the great Italian poet was created by reading Lord
65 Byron's poem, "The Lament of Dante." From that hour we felt like
72 examining everything connected with the great Italian poet. The history
67 of poets, as well as painters, is written in their works. The best
73 written life of Goldsmith is to be found in his poem of "The Traveller,"
66 and his novel of "The Vicar of Wakefield." Boswell could not have
64 written a better life of himself than he has done in giving the
73 Biography of Dr. Johnson. It seems clear that no one can be a great poet
70 without having been sometime during life a lover, and having lost the
71 object of his affection in some mysterious way. Burns had his Highland
70 Mary, Byron his Mary, and Dante was not without his Beatrice. Whether
71 there ever lived such a person as Beatrice seems to be a question upon
68 which neither of his biographers have thrown much light. However, a
72 Beatrice existed in the poet's mind, if not on earth. His attachment to
72 Beatrice Portinari, and the linking of her name with the immortality of
72 his great poem, left an indelible impression upon his future character.
65 The marriage of the object of his affections to another, and her
66 subsequent death, and the poet's exile from his beloved Florence,
71 together with his death amongst strangers--all give an interest to the
71 poet's writings, which could not be heightened by romance itself. When
72 exiled and in poverty, Dante found a friend in the father of Francesca.
72 And here, under the roof of his protector, he wrote his great poem. The
71 time the painter has chosen is evening. Day and night meet in mid-air:
69 one star is alone visible. Sailing in vacancy are the shadows of the
70 lovers. The countenance of Francesca is expressive of hopeless agony.
70 The delineations are sublime, the conception is of the highest order,
73 and the execution admirable. Dante is seated in a marble vestibule, in a
70 meditating attitude, the face partly concealed by the right hand upon
71 which it is resting. On the whole, it is an excellently painted piece,
63 and causes one to go back with a fresh relish to the Italian's
70 celebrated poem. In coming out, we stopped a short while in the upper
61 room of the Gallery, and spent a few minutes over a painting
71 representing Mrs. Siddons in one of Shakspere's characters. This is by
69 Sir Joshua Reynolds, and is only one of the many pieces that we have
68 seen of this great artist. His genius was vast, and powerful in its
73 grasp. His fancy fertile, and his inventive faculty inexhaustible in its
65 resources. He displayed the very highest powers of genius by the
70 thorough originality of his conceptions, and by the entirely new path
73 that he struck out in art. Well may Englishmen be proud of his name. And
72 as time shall step between his day and those that follow after him, the
69 more will his works be appreciated. We have since visited his grave,
43 and stood over his monument in St. Paul's.

1 
70 Some days since, I left the Metropolis to fulfil a few engagements to
72 visit provincial towns; and after a ride of nearly eight hours, we were
72 in sight of the ancient city of York. It was night, the moon was in her
63 zenith, and there seemed nothing between her and the earth but
70 glittering gold. The moon, the stars, and the innumerable gas-lights,
72 gave the city a panoramic appearance. Like a mountain starting out of a
73 plain, there stood the Cathedral in all its glory, looking down upon the
70 surrounding buildings, with all the appearance of a Gulliver standing
64 over the Lilliputians. Night gave us no opportunity to view the
66 Minster. However, we were up the next morning before the sun, and
70 walking round the Cathedral with a degree of curiosity seldom excited
70 within us. It is thought that a building of the same dimensions would
71 take fifty years to complete it at the present time, even with all the
72 improvements of the nineteenth century, and would cost no less than the
71 enormous sum of two millions of pounds sterling. From what I had heard
69 of this famous Cathedral, my expectations were raised to the highest
65 point; but it surpassed all the idea that I had formed of it. On
73 entering the building, we lost all thought of the external appearance by
72 the matchless beauty of the interior. The echo produced by the tread of
70 our feet upon the floor as we entered, resounding through the aisles,
70 seemed to say "Put off your shoes, for the place whereon you tread is
67 holy ground." We stood with hat in hand, and gazed with wonder and
73 astonishment down the incomparable vista of more than five hundred feet.
71 The organ, which stands near the centre of the building, is said to be
70 one of the finest in the world. A wall, in front of which is a screen
67 of the most gorgeous and florid architecture and executed in solid
64 stone, separates the nave from the service choir. The beautiful
73 workmanship of this makes it appear so perfect, as almost to produce the
68 belief that it is tracery work of wood. We ascended the rough stone
71 steps through a winding stair to the turrets, where we had such a view
71 of the surrounding country, as can be obtained from no other place. On
69 the top of the centre and highest turret, is a grotesque figure of a
73 fiddler; rather a strange looking object, we thought, to occupy the most
60 elevated pinnacle on the house of God. All dwellings in the
69 neighbourhood appear like so many dwarfs couching at the feet of the
69 Minster; while its own vastness and beauty impress the observer with
64 feelings of awe and sublimity. As we stood upon the top of this
69 stupendous mountain of ecclesiastical architecture, and surveyed the
73 picturesque hills and valleys around, imagination recalled the tumult of
72 the sanguinary battles fought in sight of the edifice. The rebellion of
69 Octavius near three thousand years ago, his defeat and flight to the
70 Scots, his return and triumph over the Romans, and being crowned king
71 of all Britain; the assassination of Oswald king of the Northumbrians;
71 the flaying alive of Osbert; the crowning of Richard III; the siege by
73 William the Conqueror; the siege by Cromwell, and the pomp and splendour
65 with which the different monarchs had been received in York, all
72 appeared to be vividly before me. While we were thus calling to our aid
71 our knowledge of history, a sweet peal from the lungs of the ponderous
70 organ below cut short our stay among the turrets, and we descended to
73 have our organ of tune gratified, as well as to finish the inspection of
14 the interior.
1 
65 I have heard the sublime melodies of Handel, Hayden, and Mozart,
70 performed by the most skilful musicians; I have listened with delight
71 and awe to the soul-moving compositions of those masters, as they have
69 been chaunted in the most magnificent churches; but never did I hear
70 such music, and played upon such an instrument, as that sent forth by
71 the great organ in the Cathedral of York. The verger took much delight
67 in showing us the Horn that was once mounted with gold, but is now
73 garnished with brass. We viewed the monuments and tombs of the departed,
73 and then spent an hour before the great north window. The designs on the
70 painted glass, which tradition states was given to the church by five
73 virgin sisters, is the finest thing of the kind in Great Britain. I felt
67 a relief on once more coming into the open air and again beholding
73 Nature's own sun-light. The splendid ruins of St. Mary's Abbey, with its
70 eight beautiful light gothic windows, next attracted our attention. A
70 visit to the Castle finished our stay in York; and as we were leaving
71 the old city we almost imagined that we heard the chiming of the bells
71 for the celebration of the first Christian Sabbath, with Prince Arthur
25 as the presiding genius.

67 England stands pre-eminently the first government in the world for
73 freedom of speech and of the press. Not even in our own beloved America,
65 can the man who feels himself oppressed speak as he can in Great
70 Britain. In some parts of England, however, the freedom of thought is
64 tolerated to a greater extent than in others; and of the places
70 favourable to reforms of all kinds, calculated to elevate and benefit
67 mankind, Newcastle-on-Tyne doubtless takes the lead. Surrounded by
70 innumerable coal mines, it furnishes employment for a large labouring
71 population, many of whom take a deep interest in the passing events of
71 the day, and, consequently, are a reading class. The public debater or
73 speaker, no matter what may be his subject, who fails to get an audience
69 in other towns, is sure of a gathering in the Music Hall, or Lecture
72 Room in Newcastle. Here I first had an opportunity of coming in contact
68 with a portion of the labouring people of Britain. I have addressed
72 large and influential meetings in Newcastle and the neighbouring towns,
72 and the more I see and learn of the condition of the working-classes of
71 England the more I am satisfied of the utter fallacy of the statements
70 often made that their condition approximates to that of the slaves of
68 America. Whatever may be the disadvantages that the British peasant
72 labours under, he is free; and if he is not satisfied with his employer
68 he can make choice of another. He also has the right to educate his
67 children; and he is the equal of the most wealthy person before an
72 English Court of Justice. But how is it with the American Slave? He has
73 no right to himself, no right to protect his wife, his child, or his own
67 person. He is nothing more than a living tool. Beyond his field or
69 workshop he knows nothing. There is no amount of ignorance he is not
72 capable of. He has not the least idea of the face of this earth, nor of
70 the history or constitution of the country in which he dwells. To him
67 the literature, science, and art--the progressive history, and the
71 accumulated discoveries of bygone ages, are as if they had never been.
67 The past is to him as yesterday, and the future scarcely more than
71 to-morrow. Ancestral monuments, he has none; written documents fraught
70 with cogitations of other times, he has none; and any instrumentality
63 calculated to awaken and expound the intellectual activity and
71 comprehension of a present or approaching generation, he has none. His
72 condition is that of the leopard of his own native Africa. It lives, it
72 propagates its kind; but never does it indicate a movement towards that
65 all but angelic intelligence of man. The slave eats, drinks, and
66 sleeps--all for the benefit of the man who claims his body as his
73 property. Before the tribunals of his country he has no voice. He has no
71 higher appeal than the mere will of his owner. He knows nothing of the
72 inspired Apostles through their writings. He has no Sabbath, no Church,
73 no Bible, no means of grace,--and yet we are told that he is as well off
73 as the labouring classes of England. It is not enough that the people of
67 my country should point to their Declaration of Independence which
70 declares that "all men are created equal." It is not enough that they
73 should laud to the skies a constitution containing boasting declarations
73 in favour of freedom. It is not enough that they should extol the genius
71 of Washington, the patriotism of Henry, or the enthusiasm of Otis. The
73 time has come when nations are judged by the acts of the present instead
71 of the past. And so it must be with America. In no place in the United
65 Kingdom has the American Slave warmer friends than in Newcastle.

68 I am now in Sheffield, and have just returned from a visit to James
71 Montgomery, the poet. In company with James Wall, Esq., I proceeded to
73 The Mount, the residence of Mr. Montgomery; and our names being sent in,
69 we were soon in the presence of the "Christian Poet." He held in his
71 left hand the _Eclectic Review_ for the month, and with the right gave
73 me a hearty shake, and bade me "Welcome to old England." He was anything
73 but like the portraits I had seen of him, and the man I had in my mind's
71 eye. I had just been reading his "Pelican Island," and I eyed the poet
72 with no little interest. He is under the middle size, his forehead high
67 and well formed, the top of which was a little bald; his hair of a
72 yellowish colour, his eyes rather small and deep set, the nose long and
73 slightly aquiline, his mouth rather small, and not at all pretty. He was
69 dressed in black, and a large white cravat entirely hid his neck and
67 chin: his having been afflicted from childhood with salt-rhum, was
66 doubtless the cause of his chin being so completely buried in the
67 neckcloth. Upon the whole, he looked more like one of our American
72 Methodist parsons, than any one I have seen in this country. He entered
73 freely into conversation with us. He said he should be glad to attend my
67 lecture that evening, but that he had long since quit going out at
67 night. He mentioned having heard William Lloyd Garrison some years
70 before, and with whom he was well pleased. He said it had long been a
70 puzzle to him, how Americans could hold slaves and still retain their
71 membership in the churches. When we rose to leave, the old man took my
67 hand between his two, and with tears in his eyes said, "Go on your
66 Christian mission, and may the Lord protect and prosper you. Your
71 enslaved countrymen have my sympathy, and shall have my prayers." Thus
71 ended our visit to the Bard of Sheffield. Long after I had quitted the
68 presence of the poet, the following lines of his were ringing in my
8 ears:--
1 
38    "Wanderer, whither dost thou roam?
34     Weary wanderer, old and grey,
40     Wherefore has thou left thine home,
30     In the sunset of thy day.
34     Welcome wanderer as thou art,
33     All my blessings to partake;
36     Yet thrice welcome to my heart,
37     For thine injured people's sake.
42     Wanderer, whither would'st thou roam?
29     To what region far away?
35     Bend thy steps to find a home,
32     In the twilight of thy day.
31     Where a tyrant never trod,
36     Where a slave was never known--
34     But where Nature worships God
30     In the wilderness alone."
1 
1 
73 Mr. Montgomery seems to have thrown his entire soul into his meditations
71 on the wrongs of Switzerland. The poem from which we have just quoted,
72 is unquestionably one of his best productions, and contains more of the
72 fire of enthusiasm than all his other works. We feel a reverence almost
71 amounting to superstition, for the poet who deals with nature. And who
72 is more capable of understanding the human heart than the poet? Who has
68 better known the human feelings than Shakspere; better painted than
73 Milton, the grandeur of Virtue; better sighed than Byron over the subtle
63 weaknesses of Hope? Who ever had a sounder taste, a more exact
71 intellect than Dante? or who has ever tuned his harp more in favour of
32 Freedom, than our own Whittier?

68 In passing through Yorkshire, we could not resist the temptation it
65 offered, to pay a visit to the extensive and interesting ruin of
73 Kirkstall Abbey, which lies embosomed in a beautiful recess of Airedale,
67 about three miles from Leeds. A pleasant drive over a smooth road,
68 brought us abruptly in sight of the Abbey. The tranquil and pensive
71 beauty of the desolate Monastery, as it reposes in the lap of pastoral
72 luxuriance, and amidst the touching associations of seven centuries, is
69 almost beyond description when viewed from where we first beheld it.
71 After arriving at its base, we stood for some moments under the mighty
67 arches that lead into the great hall, gazing at its old grey walls
70 frowning with age. At the distance of a small field, the Aire is seen
73 gliding past the foot of the lawn on which the ruin stands, after it has
71 left those precincts, sparkling over a weir with a pleasing murmur. We
64 could fully enter into the feelings of the Poet when he says:--
1 
36    "Beautiful fabric! even in decay
45       And desolation, beauty still is thine;
41     As the rich sunset of an autumn day,
52       When gorgeous clouds in glorious hues combine
42     To render homage to its slow decline,
44       Is more majestic in its parting hour:
45     Even so thy mouldering, venerable shrine
43       Possesses now a more subduing power,
64     Than in thine earlier sway, with pomp and pride thy dower."
1 
1 
70 The tale of "Mary, the Maid of the Inn," is supposed, and not without
71 foundation, to be connected with this Abbey. "Hark to Rover," the name
73 of the house where the key is kept, was, a century ago, a retired inn or
73 pot-house, and the haunt of many a desperate highwayman and poacher. The
71 anecdote is so well known, that it is scarcely necessary to relate it.
32 It, however, is briefly this:--
1 
65 "One stormy night, as two travellers sat at the inn, each having
68 exhausted his news, the conversation was directed to the Abbey, the
73 boisterous night, and Mary's heroism; when a bet was at last made by one
70 of them, that she would not go and bring back from the nave a slip of
71 the alder-tree growing there. Mary, however, did go; but having nearly
68 reached the tree, she heard a low, indistinct dialogue; at the same
68 time, something black fell and rolled towards her, which afterwards
68 proved to be a hat. Directing her attention to the place whence the
72 conversation proceeded, she saw, from behind a pillar, two men carrying
69 a murdered body: they passed near the place where she stood, a heavy
61 cloud was swept from off the face of the moon, and Mary fell
66 senseless--one of the murderers was her intended husband! She was
73 awakened from her swoon, but--her reason had fled for ever." Mr. Southey
73 wrote a beautiful poem founded on this story, which will be found in his
72 published works. We spent nearly three hours in wandering through these
70 splendid ruins. It is both curious and interesting to trace the early
66 history of these old piles, which become the resort of thousands,
70 nine-tenths of whom are unaware either of the classic ground on which
70 they tread, or of the peculiar interest thrown around the spot by the
22 deeds of remote ages.
1 
71 During our stay in Leeds, we had the good fortune to become acquainted
68 with Wilson Armistead, Esq. This gentleman is well known as an able
70 writer against Slavery. His most elaborate work is "A Tribute for the
65 Negro." This is a volume of 560 pages, and is replete with facts
72 refuting the charges of inferiority brought against the Negro race. Few
67 English gentlemen have done more to hasten the day of the American
43 slave's liberation, than Wilson Armistead.

72 We have just paid a visit to Newstead Abbey, the far-famed residence of
65 Lord Byron. I posted from Hucknall over to Newstead one pleasant
70 morning, and, being provided with a letter of introduction to Colonel
71 Wildman, I lost no time in presenting myself at the door of the Abbey.
71 But, unfortunately for me, the Colonel was at Mansfield, in attendance
66 at the Assizes--he being one of the County Magistrates. I did not
68 however lose the object of my visit, as every attention was paid in
71 showing me about the premises. I felt as every one must, who gazes for
70 the first time upon these walls, and remembers that it was here, even
70 amid the comparative ruins of a building once dedicated to the sacred
73 cause of Religion and her twin sister, Charity, that the genius of Byron
69 was first developed. Here that he paced with youthful melancholy the
63 halls of his illustrious ancestors, and trode the walks of the
68 long-banished monks. The housekeeper--a remarkably good looking and
72 polite woman--showed us through the different apartments, and explained
70 in the most minute manner every object of interest connected with the
69 interior of the building. We first visited the Monks' Parlour, which
62 seemed to contain nothing of note, except a very fine stained
73 window--one of the figures representing St. Paul, surmounted by a cross.
65 We passed through Lord Byron's Bedroom, the Haunted Chamber, the
71 Library, and the Eastern Corridor, and halted in the Tapestry Bedroom,
73 which is truly a magnificent apartment, formed by the Byrons for the use
73 of King Charles II. The ceiling is richly decorated with the Byron arms.
67 We next visited the grand Drawing-room, probably the finest in the
69 building. This saloon contains a large number of splendid portraits,
70 among which is the celebrated portrait of Lord Byron, by Phillips. In
73 this room we took into our hand the Skull-cup, of which so much has been
73 written, and that has on it a short inscription, commencing with--"Start
72 not--nor deem my spirit fled." Leaving this noble room, we descended by
71 a few polished oak steps into the West Corridor, from which we entered
73 the grand Dining Hall, and through several other rooms, until we reached
72 the Chapel. Here we were shown a stone coffin which had been found near
72 the high altar, when the workmen were excavating the vault, intended by
73 Lord Byron for himself and his dog. The coffin contained the skeleton of
70 an Abbot, and also the identical skull from which the cup, of which I
67 have made mention, was made. We then left the building, and took a
72 stroll through the grounds. After passing a pond of cold crystal water,
69 we came to a dark wood in which are two leaden statues of Pan, and a
73 female satyr--very fine specimens as works of art. We here inspected the
72 tree whereon Byron carved his own name and that of his sister, with the
73 date, all of which are still legible. However, the tree is now dead, and
73 we were informed that Colonel Wildman intended to have it cut down so as
67 to preserve the part containing the inscription. After crossing an
71 interesting and picturesque part of the gardens, we arrived within the
70 precincts of the ancient Chapel, near which we observed a neat marble
70 monument, and which we supposed to have been erected to the memory of
70 some of the Byrons; but, on drawing near to it, we read the following
15 inscription:--
1 
32                 "Near this spot
41         are deposited the remains of one
43       who possessed beauty without vanity,
38           strength without insolence,
38             courage without ferocity,
50     and all the virtues of man without his vices.
50   This praise, which would be unmeaning flattery,
39         if inscribed over human ashes,
45       is but a just tribute to the memory of
32               BOATSWAIN, a dog,
45     Who was born at Newfoundland, May, 1803,
50   and died at Newstead Abbey, November 18, 1808."
1 
1 
72 By a will which his Lordship executed in 1811, he directed that his own
71 body should be buried in a vault in the garden, near his faithful dog.
73 This feeling of affection to his dumb and faithful follower, commendable
71 in itself, seems here to have been carried beyond the bounds of reason
15 and propriety.
1 
71 In another part of the grounds we saw the oak tree planted by the poet
70 himself. It has now attained a goodly size, considering the growth of
70 the oak, and bids fair to become a lasting memento to the Noble Bard,
72 and to be a shrine to which thousands of pilgrims will resort in future
72 ages, to do homage to his mighty genius. This tree promises to share in
70 after times the celebrity of Shakspere's mulberry, and Pope's willow.
71 Near by, and in the tall trees, the rooks were keeping up a tremendous
68 noise. After seeing everything of interest connected with the great
72 poet, we entered our chaise, and left the premises. As we were leaving,
66 I turned to take a farewell look at the Abbey, standing in solemn
71 grandeur, the long ivy clinging fondly to the rich tracery of a former
72 age. Proceeding to the little town of Hucknall, we entered the old grey
69 Parish Church, which has for ages been the last resting-place of the
70 Byrons, and where repose the ashes of the Poet, marked only by a neat
71 marble slab, bearing the date of the poet's birth, death, and the fact
72 that the tablet was placed there by his sister. This closed my visit to
64 the interesting scenes associated with Byron's strange eventful
72 history--scenes that ever acquire a growing charm as the lapse of years
68 softens the errors of the man, and confirms the genius of the poet.

1 
67 It was on a lovely morning that I found myself on board the little
72 steamer _Wye_, passing out of Bristol harbour. In going down the river,
71 we saw on our right, the stupendous rocks of St. Vincent towering some
73 four or five hundred feet above our heads. By the swiftness of our fairy
71 steamer, we were soon abreast of Cook's Folly, a singular tower, built
65 by a man from whom it takes its name, and of which the following
71 romantic story is told:--"Some years since a gentleman, of the name of
70 Cook, erected this tower, which has since gone by the name of 'Cook's
68 Folly.' A son having been born, he was desirous of ascertaining, by
66 means of astrology, if he would live to enjoy his property. Being
72 himself a firm believer, like the poet Dryden, that certain information
64 might be obtained from the above science, he caused the child's
68 horoscope to be drawn, and found, to his dismay, that in his third,
71 sixteenth, or twenty-first year, he would be in danger of meeting with
68 some fearful calamity or sudden death, to avert which he caused the
70 turret to be constructed, and the child placed therein. Secure, as he
70 vainly thought, there he lived, attended by a faithful servant, their
71 food and fuel being conveyed to them by means of a pully-basket, until
71 he was old enough to wait upon himself. On the eve of his twenty-first
66 year, his parent's hopes rose high, and great were the rejoicings
68 prepared to welcome the young heir to his home. But, alas! no human
70 skill could avert the dark fate which clung to him. The last night he
73 had to pass alone in the turret, a bundle of faggots was conveyed to him
71 as usual, in which lay concealed a viper, which clung to his hand. The
73 bite was fatal; and, instead of being borne in triumph, the dead body of
71 his only son was the sad spectacle which met the sight of his father."
1 
63 We crossed the channel and soon entered the mouth of that most
70 picturesque of rivers, the Wye. As we neared the town of Chepstow the
65 old Castle made its appearance, and a fine old ruin it is. Being
68 previously provided with a letter of introduction to a gentleman in
70 Chepstow, I lost no time in finding him out. This gentleman gave me a
71 cordial reception, and did what Englishmen seldom ever do, lent me his
73 saddle horse to ride to the Abbey. While lunch was in preparation I took
71 a stroll through the Castle which stood near by. We entered the Castle
69 through the great door-way and were soon treading the walls that had
70 once sustained the cannon and the sentinel, but were now covered with
69 weeds and wild flowers. The drum and fife had once been heard within
70 these walls--the only music now is the cawing of the rook and daw. We
73 paid a hasty visit to the various apartments, remaining longest in those
71 of most interest. The room in which Martin the Regicide was imprisoned
70 nearly twenty years, was pointed out to us. The Castle of Chepstow is
73 still a magnificent pile, towering upon the brink of a stupendous cliff,
72 on reaching the top of which, we had a splendid view of the surrounding
69 country. Time, however, compelled us to retrace our steps, and after
67 partaking of a lunch, we mounted a horse for the first time in ten
72 years, and started for Tintern Abbey. The distance from Chepstow to the
68 Abbey is about five miles, and the road lies along the banks of the
70 river. The river is walled in on either side by hills of much beauty,
72 clothed from base to summit with the richest verdure. I can conceive of
68 nothing more striking than the first appearance of the Abbey. As we
70 rounded a hill, all at once we saw the old ruin standing before us in
69 all its splendour. This celebrated ecclesiastical relic of the olden
67 time is doubtless the finest ruin of its kind in Europe. Embosomed
73 amongst hills, and situated on the banks of the most fairy-like river in
66 the world, its beauty can scarcely be surpassed. We halted at the
70 "Beaufort Arms," left our horse, and sallied forth to view the Abbey.
71 The sun was pouring a flood of light upon the old grey walls, lighting
71 up its dark recesses, as if to give us a better opportunity of viewing
71 it. I gazed with astonishment and admiration at its many beauties, and
68 especially at the superb gothic windows over the entrance door. The
68 beautiful gothic pillars, with here and there a representation of a
71 praying priest, and mailed knights, with saints and Christian martyrs,
71 and the hundreds of Scriptural representations, all indicate that this
67 was a place of considerable importance in its palmy days. The once
72 stone floor had disappeared, and we found ourselves standing on a floor
72 of unbroken green grass, swelling back to the old walls, and looking so
69 verdant and silken that it seemed the very floor of fancy. There are
70 more romantic and wilder places than this in the world, but none more
65 beautiful. The preservation of these old abbeys should claim the
73 attention of those under whose charge they are, and we felt like joining
28 with the poet and saying:--
1 
43                            "O ye who dwell
48     Around yon ruins, guard the precious charge
49     From hands profane! O save the sacred pile--
47     O'er which the wing of centuries has flown
44     Darkly and silently, deep-shadowing all
50     Its pristine honours--from the ruthless grasp
26     Of future violation."
1 
1 
71 In contemplating these ruins more closely, the mind insensibly reverts
72 to the period of feudal and regal oppression, when structures like that
63 of Tintern Abbey necessarily became the scenes of stirring and
71 highly-important events. How altered is the scene! Where were formerly
70 magnificence and splendour; the glittering array of priestly prowess;
65 the crowded halls of haughty bigots, and the prison of religious
70 offenders; there is now but a heap of mouldering ruins. The oppressed
69 and the oppressor have long since lain down together in the peaceful
67 grave. The ruin, generally speaking, is unusually perfect, and the
72 sculpture still beautifully sharp. The outward walls are nearly entire,
70 and are thickly clad with ivy. Many of the windows are also in a good
66 state of preservation; but the roof has long since fallen in. The
67 feathered songsters were fluttering about, and pouring forth their
69 artless lays as a tribute of joy; while the lowing of the herds, the
73 bleating of flocks, and the hum of bees upon the farm near by, all burst
69 upon the ear, and gave the scene a picturesque sublimity that can be
72 easier imagined than described. Most assuredly Shakspere had such ruins
28 in view when he exclaimed--
1 
51    "The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
48     The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
48     Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve--
47     And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,
31     Leave not a wreck behind."
1 
1 
70 In the afternoon we returned to Bristol, and I spent the greater part
67 of the next day in examining the interior of Redcliffe Church. Few
71 places in the West of England have greater claims upon the topographer
71 and historian than the church of St. Mary's, Redcliffe. Its antiquity,
62 the beauty of its architecture, and above all the interesting
73 circumstances connected with its history, entitle it to peculiar notice.
70 It is also associated with the enterprise of genius; for its name has
63 been blended with the reputation of Rowley, of Canynge, and of
67 Chatterton; and no lover of poetry and admirer of art can visit it
69 without a degree of enthusiasm. And when the old building shall have
68 mouldered into ruins, even these will be trodden with veneration as
71 sacred to the recollection of genius of the highest order. Ascending a
71 winding stair, we were shown into the Treasury Room. The room forms an
69 irregular octagon, admitting light through narrow unglazed apertures
71 upon the broken and scattered fragments of the famous Rowleian chests,
71 that with the rubble and dust of centuries cover the floor. It is here
65 creative fancy pictures forth the sad image of the spirit of the
71 spot--the ardent boy, flushed and fed by hope, musing on the brilliant
72 deception he had conceived--whose daring attempt has left his name unto
50 the intellectual world as a marvel and a mystery.
1 
69 That a boy under twelve years of age should write a series of poems,
71 imitating the style of the fifteenth century, and palm these poems off
72 upon the world as the work of a monk, is indeed strange; and that these
70 should become the object of interesting contemplation to the literary
66 world, and should awaken inquiries, and exercise the talents of a
68 Southey, a Bryant, a Miller, a Mathias, and others, savours more of
65 romance than reality. I had visited the room in a garret in High
67 Holborn, where this poor boy died. I had stood over a grave in the
72 burial-ground of the Lane Workhouse, which was pointed out to me as the
73 last resting-place of Chatterton; and now I was in the room where it was
69 alleged he obtained the manuscripts that gave him such notoriety. We
69 descended and viewed other portions of the church. The effect of the
71 chancel, as seen behind the pictures, is very singular, and suggestive
67 of many swelling thoughts. We look at the great east window, it is
69 unadorned with its wonted painted glass; we look at the altar-screen
72 beneath, on which the light of day again falls, and behold the injuries
72 it has received at the hands of time. There is a dreary mournfulness in
73 the scene which fastens on the mind, and is in unison with the time-worn
73 mouldering fragments that are seen all around us. And this dreariness is
71 not removed by our tracing the destiny of man on the storied pavements
71 or on the graven brass, that still bears upon its surface the names of
71 those who obtained the world's regard years back. This old pile is not
69 only an ornament to the city, but it stands a living monument to the
71 genius of its founder. Bristol has long sustained a high position as a
70 place from which the American Abolitionists have received substantial
67 encouragement in their arduous labours for the emancipation of the
71 slaves of that land; and the writer of this received the best evidence
62 that in this respect the character of the people had not been
69 exaggerated, especially as regards the "Clifton Ladies' Anti-Slavery
10 Society."

18 and Ellen Craft._
1 
1 
66 I have visited few places where I found more warm friends than in
48 Aberdeen. This is the Granite City of Scotland.
1 
72 Aberdeen reminds one of Boston, especially in a walk down Union Street,
60 which is said to be one of the finest promenades in Europe.
1 
71 The town is situated on a neck of land between the rivers Dee and Don,
69 and is the most important place in the north of Scotland. During our
71 third day in the city, we visited among other places the Old Bridge of
71 Don, which is not only resorted to on account of its antique celebrity
71 and peculiar appearance, but also because of the notoriety that it has
52 gained by Lord Byron's poem of the "Bridge of Don."
1 
73 An engagement to be in Edinburgh and vicinity, cut short our stay in the
71 north. The very mild state of the weather, and a wish to see something
68 of the coast between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, induced us to make the
18 journey by water.
1 
73 On Friday evening, the 14th, after delivering a lecture before the Total
71 Abstinence Society, in company with William and Ellen Craft, I went on
72 board the steamer bound for Edinburgh. On reaching the vessel, we found
71 the drawing-room almost entirely at our service, and prejudice against
63 colour being unknown, we had no difficulty in getting the best
69 accommodation which the steamer could furnish. This is so unlike the
68 pro-slavery, negro-hating spirit of America, that the Crafts seemed
68 almost bewildered by the transition. I had been in the saloon but a
71 short time, when, looking at the newspapers on the table, I discovered
73 the _North Star_. It was like meeting with a friend in a strange land. I
73 looked in vain on the margin for the name of its owner, but as I did not
71 feel at liberty to take it, and as it appeared to be alone, I laid the
44 _Liberator_ by its side to keep it company.
1 
67 The night was a glorious one. The sky was without a speck; and the
73 clear, piercing air had a brilliancy I have seldom seen. The moon was in
70 its zenith--the steamer and surrounding objects were beautiful in the
71 extreme. The boat got under weigh at a little past twelve, and we were
73 soon out at sea. The "Queen" is a splendid craft, and without the aid of
73 sails, was able to make fifteen miles within the hour. I was up the next
71 morning before the sun, and found the sea as on the previous night--as
68 calm and smooth as a mirror. It was a delightful morning, more like
72 April than February; and the sun, as it rose, seemed to fire every peak
71 of the surrounding hills. On our left, lay the Island of May, while to
70 the right was to be seen the small fishing town of Anstruther, twenty
72 miles distant from Edinburgh. Beyond these, on either side, was a range
70 of undulating blue mountains, swelling as they retired, into a bolder
71 outline and a loftier altitude, until they terminated some twenty-five
71 or thirty miles in the dim distance. A friend at my side pointed out a
67 place on the right, where the remains of an old castle or look-out
66 house, used in the time of the border wars, once stood, and which
42 reminded us of the barbarism of the past.
1 
73 But these signs are fast disappearing. The plough and roller have passed
70 over many of these foundations, and the time will soon come, when the
72 antiquarian will look in vain for those places that history has pointed
71 out to him, as connected with the political and religious struggles of
65 the past. The steward of the vessel came round to see who of the
72 passengers wished for breakfast, and as the keen air of the morning had
67 given me an appetite, and there being no prejudice on the score of
71 colour, I took my seat at the table and gave ample evidence that I was
71 not an invalid. On returning to the deck again, I found we had entered
71 the Forth, and that "Modern Athens" was in sight; and, far above every
72 other object, with its turrets almost lost in the clouds, could be seen
72 Edinburgh Castle. After landing, a pleasant ride over one of the finest
73 roads in Scotland, with a sprinkling of beautiful villas on either side,
40 brought us once more to Cannon's Hotel.
1 
71 In a city like Edinburgh, there is always something to keep the public
70 alive, but during our three days' stay in the town, on this occasion,
70 there were topics under discussion which seemed to excite the people,
72 although I had been told that the Scotch were not excitable. Indeed all
73 Edinburgh seemed to have gone mad about the Pope. If his Holiness should
69 think fit to pay a visit to his new dominions, I would advise him to
33 keep out of reach of the Scotch.
1 
73 In company with the Crafts, I visited the Calton Hill, from which we had
64 a delightful view of the city and surrounding country. I had an
71 opportunity during my stay in the city, of visiting the Infirmary, and
66 was pleased to see among the two or three hundred students, three
72 coloured young men, seated upon the same benches with those of a fairer
72 complexion, and yet there appeared no feeling on the part of the whites
72 towards their coloured associates, except of companionship and respect.
65 One of the cardinal truths, both of religion and freedom, is the
66 equality and brotherhood of man. In the sight of God and all just
66 institutions, the whites can claim no precedence or privilege, on
69 account of their being white; and if coloured men are not treated as
67 they should be in the educational institutions in America, it is a
67 pleasure to know that all distinction ceases by crossing the broad
68 Atlantic. I had scarcely left the lecture room of the Institute and
71 reached the street, when I met a large number of the students on their
69 way to the college, and here again were seen coloured men arm in arm
66 with whites. The proud American who finds himself in the splendid
73 streets of Edinburgh, and witnesses such scenes as these, can but behold
73 in them the degradation of his own country, whose laws would make slaves
62 of these same young men, should they appear in the streets of
27 Charleston or New Orleans.
1 
70 After all, our country is the most despotic in the wide world, and to
73 expose and hold it up to the scorn and contempt of other nations, is the
70 duty of every coloured man who would be true to himself and his race.
1 
1 
72 During my stay in Edinburgh, I accepted an invitation to breakfast with
72 the great champion of Philosophical Phrenology. Few foreigners are more
69 admired in America, than the author of "The Constitution of Man."[B]
72 Although not far from 70 years of age, I found him apparently as active
72 and as energetic as many men of half that age. He was much pleased with
72 Mr. and Mrs. Craft, who formed a part of the breakfast party. It may be
69 a pleasure to the friends of these two fugitive slaves, to know that
67 they are now the inmates of a good school where they are now being
72 educated. For this, they are mainly indebted to that untiring friend of
73 the Slave, John B. Estlin, Esq., of Bristol, whose zeal and co-operation
69 with the American Abolitionists, have gained for him an undying name
46 with the friends of freedom in the New World.

1 
1 
50                     EDINBURGH, _January 1, 1851_.
1 
55 You will see by the date of this that I am spending my
68 New-Year's-Day in the Scottish Capital, in company with our friend,
73 William Craft. I came by invitation to attend a meeting of the Edinburgh
30 Ladies' Emancipation Society.
1 
68 The meeting was held on Monday evening last, at which William Craft
71 gave, for the first time, since his arrival in this country, a history
68 of his escape from Georgia, two years ago, together with his recent
20 flight from Boston.
1 
69 Craft's reception was one of deep enthusiasm, and his story was well
71 told, and made a powerful impression on the audience. I would that the
71 slaveholders, Hughes and Knight, could have been present and heard the
72 thundering applause with which our friend was received on the following
68 evening. Craft attended a meeting of the Edinburgh Total Abstinence
67 Society, before which I lectured, and his appearance here was also
72 hailed with much enthusiasm. Our friend bids fair to become a favourite
17 with the Scotch.
1 
71 Much regret was expressed that Ellen was not present. She was detained
73 in Liverpool by indisposition. But Mrs. Craft has so far recovered, that
30 we expect her here to-morrow.
1 
70 The appearance of these two fugitives in Great Britain, at this time,
70 and under the circumstances, will aid our cause, and create a renewed
65 hatred to the abominable institution of American slavery. I have
69 received letters from a number of the friends of the slave, in which
69 they express a wish to aid the Crafts; and among the first of these,
69 were our good friends, John B. Estlin, Esq., of Bristol, and Harriet
11 Martineau.
1 
70 But I must give you my impression of this fine city. Edinburgh is the
72 most picturesque of all the towns which I have visited since my arrival
71 in the father-land. Its situation has been compared to that of Athens,
72 but it is said that the modern Athens is superior to the ancient. I was
69 deeply impressed with the idea that I had seen the most beautiful of
73 cities, after beholding those fashionable resorts, Paris and Versailles.
69 I have seen nothing in the way of public grounds to compare with the
68 gardens of Versailles, or the _Champs Elysees_ at Paris; and as for
71 statuary, the latter place is said to take the lead of the rest of the
7 world.
1 
72 The general appearance of Edinburgh prepossesses one in its favour. The
70 town being built upon the brows of a large terrace, presents the most
73 wonderful perspective. Its first appearance to a stranger, and the first
73 impression, can scarcely be but favourable. In my first walk through the
71 town, I was struck with the difference in the appearance of the people
64 from the English. But the difference between the Scotch and the
72 Americans, is very great. The cheerfulness depicted in the countenances
73 of the people here, and their free and easy appearance, is very striking
73 to a stranger. He who taught the sun to shine, the flowers to bloom, the
65 birds to sing, and blesses us with rain, never intended that his
66 creatures should look sad. There is a wide difference between the
73 Americans and any other people which I have seen. The Scotch are healthy
61 and robust, unlike the long-faced, sickly-looking Americans.
1 
73 While on our journey from London to Paris, to attend the Peace Congress,
70 I could not but observe the marked difference between the English and
67 American delegates. The former looked as if their pockets had been
69 filled with sandwiches, made of good bread and roast beef, while the
68 latter appeared as if their pockets had been filled with Holloway's
34 Pills, and Mrs. Kidder's Cordial.
1 
71 I breakfasted this morning in a room in which the Poet Burns, as I was
70 informed, had often sat. The conversation here turned upon Burns. The
68 lady of the house pointed to a scrap of poetry which was in a frame
71 hanging on the wall, written, as she said, by the Poet, on hearing the
67 people rejoicing in a church over the intelligence of a victory. I
37 copied it and will give it to you:--
1 
42    "Ye hypocrites! are these your pranks,
39     To murder men and give God thanks?
46     For shame! give o'er, proceed no further,
46     God won't accept your thanks for murder."
1 
1 
73 The fact that I was in the room where Scotland's great national poet had
73 been a visitor, caused me to feel that I was on classic, if not hallowed
71 ground. On returning from our morning visit, we met a gentleman with a
73 coloured lady on each arm. Craft remarked in a very dry manner, "If they
73 were in Georgia, the slaveholders would make them walk in a more hurried
62 gait than they do." I said to my friend, that if he meant the
70 pro-slavery prejudice would not suffer them to walk peaceably through
72 the streets, they need go no further than the pro-slavery cities of New
66 York and Philadelphia. When walking through the streets, I amused
73 myself, by watching Craft's countenance; and in doing so, imagined I saw
69 the changes experienced by every fugitive slave in his first month's
67 residence in this country. A sixteen months' residence has not yet
33 familiarized me with the change.

1 
63 Dear Douglass,--I remained in Edinburgh a day or two after the
71 date of my last letter, which gave me an opportunity of seeing some of
67 the lions in the way of public buildings, &c., in company with our
71 friend Wm. Craft. I paid a visit to the Royal Institute, and inspected
73 the very fine collection of paintings, statues, and other productions of
66 art. The collection in the Institute is not to be compared to the
70 British Museum at London, or the Louvre at Paris, but is probably the
72 best in Scotland. Paintings from the hands of many of the masters, such
70 as Sir A. Vandyke, Tiziano, Vercellio and Van Dellen, were hanging on
70 the wall, and even the names of Reubens, and Titian, were attached to
73 some of the finer specimens. Many of these represent some of the nobles,
72 and distinguished families of Rome, Athens, Greece, &c. A beautiful one
73 representing a group of the Lomellini family of Genoa, seemed to attract
39 the attention of most of the visitors.
1 
70 In visiting this place, we passed close by the monument of Sir Walter
69 Scott. This is the most exquisite thing of the kind that I have seen
70 since coming to this country. It is said to be the finest monument in
71 Europe. There sits the author of "Waverley," with a book and pencil in
72 hand, taking notes. A beautiful dog is seated by his side. Whether this
71 is meant to represent his favourite dog, Camp, at whose death the Poet
71 shed so many tears, we were not informed; but I was of opinion that it
69 might be the faithful Percy, whose monument stands in the grounds at
69 Abbotsford. Scott was an admirer of the canine tribe. One may form a
71 good idea of the appearance of this distinguished writer, when living,
73 by viewing this remarkable statue. The statue is very beautiful, but not
71 equal to the one of Lord Byron, which was executed to be placed by the
68 side of Johnson, Milton, and Addison, in Poets' Corner, Westminster
71 Abbey; but the Parliament not allowing it a place there, it now stands
72 in one of the Colleges at Cambridge. While viewing the statue of Byron,
72 I thought he, too, should have been represented with a dog by his side,
68 for he, like Scott, was remarkably fond of dogs, so much so that he
65 intended to have his favourite, Boatswain, interred by his side.
1 
70 We paid a short visit to the monuments of Burns and Allan Ramsay, and
71 the renowned old Edinburgh Castle. The Castle is now used as a barrack
72 for Infantry. It is accessible only from the High Street, and must have
73 been impregnable before the discovery of gunpowder. In the wars with the
72 English, it was twice taken by stratagem; once in a very daring manner,
68 by climbing up the most inaccessible part of the rock upon which it
69 stands, and where a foe was least expected, and putting the guard to
73 death; and another time, by a party of soldiers disguising themselves as
65 merchants, and obtaining admission inside the Castle gates. They
73 succeeded in preventing the gates from being closed, until reinforced by
73 a party of men under Sir Wm. Douglas, who soon overpowered the occupants
15 of the Castle.
1 
65 We could not resist the temptation held out to see the Palace of
73 Holyrood. It was in this place that the beautiful, but unfortunate Mary,
71 Queen of Scots, resided for a number of years. On reaching the palace,
70 we were met at the door by an elderly looking woman, with a red face,
73 garnished with a pair of second-hand curls, the whole covered with a cap
73 having the widest border that I had seen for years. She was very kind in
68 showing us about the premises, especially as we were foreigners, no
73 doubt expecting an extra fee for politeness. The most interesting of the
72 many rooms in this ancient castle, is the one which was occupied by the
62 Queen, and where her Italian favourite, Rizzio, was murdered.
1 
65 But by far the most interesting object which we visited while in
67 Edinburgh, was the house where the celebrated Reformer, John Knox,
69 re-resided. It is a queer-looking old building, with a pulpit on the
70 outside, and above the door are the nearly obliterated remains of the
71 following inscription:--"Lufe. God. Above. Al. And. your. Nichbour. As
70 you. Self." This was probably traced under the immediate direction of
71 the great Reformer. Such an inscription put upon a house of worship at
62 the present day, would be laughed at. I have given it to you,
40 punctuation and all, just as it stands.
1 
67 The general architecture of Edinburgh is very imposing, whether we
70 regard the picturesque disorder of the buildings, in the Old Town, or
71 the symmetrical proportions of the streets and squares in the New. But
69 on viewing this city which has the reputation of being the finest in
68 Europe, I was surprised to find that it had none of those sumptuous
71 structures, which like St. Paul's, or Westminster Abbey, York Minster,
66 and some other of the English provincial Cathedrals, astonish the
73 beholder alike by their magnitude and their architectural splendour. But
72 in no city which I have visited in the kingdom, is the general standard
51 of excellence better maintained than in Edinburgh.
1 
69 I am not sure, my dear friend, whether or not I mentioned in my last
70 letter the attendance of Wm. Craft and myself at a splendid Soiree of
71 the Edinburgh Temperance Society, and our being voted in life members,
73 in the most enthusiastic manner, by the whole audience. I will here give
73 you a part of the speech of the President, as reported in the _Christian
64 News_. This should cause the pro-slavery whites, and especially
72 negro-hating Sons of Temperance, who refuse the coloured man a place in
71 their midst, to feel ashamed of their unchristian conduct. Here it is,
33 let them judge for themselves:--
1 
72 "A great feature in our meeting to-night, is that we have beside us two
65 individuals, who, according to the immaculate laws of immaculate
64 Yankeedom, have been guilty of the tremendous crime of stealing
70 themselves. (Applause.) Mr. Craft, who sits beside me, has stolen his
65 good wife, and Mrs. Craft has stolen her worthy husband; and our
72 respected friend, Mr. Brown, has cast a covetous eye on his own person.
69 In the name of the Temperance reformers of Edinburgh--in the name of
73 universal Scotland, I would welcome these two victims of the white man's
73 pride, ambition, selfishness, and cupidity. I welcome them as our equals
71 in every respect. (Great applause.) What a humiliating thought it will
69 be, surely, for our American friends on the other side of the water,
71 when they hear (and we shall endeavour to let them hear) that the very
73 man whom they consider not worthy to sit in a third class carriage along
71 with a white man, and that too in a district of country where the very
69 aristocracy deal in cheap cheese--(great applause) traffic in tallow
67 candles, and spend their nights and days among raw hides and train
69 oil--(applause)--what a humbling thought it will be for them to know
72 that these very men in the centre of educated Scotland, in the midst of
73 educated Edinburgh, are thought fit to hold even the first rank upon our
70 aristocratic platform. Let us, then, my friends, lift our voices this
66 evening in one swelling chorus for the down-trodden slave. Let us
70 publish abroad the fact to the world, that the sympathies of Scotland
71 are with the bondsman everywhere. Let us unite our voices to cry, Down
66 with the iniquitous Slave Bill!--Down with the aristocracy of the
70 skin!--Perish forever the deepest-dyed, the hardest-hearted system of
67 abomination under heaven!--Perish the sum of all villanies! Perish
37 American slavery. (Great applause.)"
1 
72 But I must leave the good and hospitable people of the Scottish Capital
73 for the present. I have taken an elaborate stock of notes, and may speak
20 of Edinburgh again.
1 
68 I left William and Ellen Craft (the latter of whom has just come to
70 Edinburgh), and took the Glasgow train, and after a ride of two hours
72 through a beautiful country, with its winding hills on either side--its
71 fertile fields, luxuriant woods, and stately mansions lying around us,
72 arrived in the muddy, dirty, smoky, foggy city of Glasgow. As I had had
72 a standing invitation from a distinguished gentleman with whom I became
73 acquainted in London, to partake of his hospitality, should I ever visit
67 Glasgow, and again received a note while in Edinburgh renewing the
70 invitation, I proceeded to his residence at Partick, three miles from
71 Glasgow. This is one of the loveliest spots which I have yet seen. Our
72 mansion is on the side of Laurel Bank, a range of the Kilpatrick hills.
43 We have a view of the surrounding country.
1 
71 On Monday evening, Jan. 6, a public meeting was held in the City Hall,
70 to extend a welcome to the American fugitive slaves. The hall, one of
64 the largest in the kingdom, was filled at an early hour. At the
66 appointed time, Alex. Hastie, Esq., M.P., entered the great room,
70 followed by the fugitives and most of the leading abolitionists, amid
66 rapturous applause. With a Member of Parliament in the chair, and
67 almost any number of clergymen on the platform, the meeting had an
72 influential appearance. From report, I had imbibed the opinion that the
69 Scotch were not easily moved, but if I may judge from the enthusiasm
73 which characterised the City Hall demonstration, I should place them but
72 little behind the English. After an excellent speech from the Chairman,
65 and spirited addresses from several clergymen, William Craft was
72 introduced to the meeting, and gave an account of the escape of himself
68 and wife from slavery, and their subsequent flight from Boston. Any
70 description of mine would give but a poor idea of the intense feeling
69 that pervaded the meeting. I think all who were there, left the hall
73 after hearing that noble fugitive, with a greater abhorrence of American
42 slavery than they previously entertained.

54                     PERTH, SCOTLAND, _Jan. 31, 1851_.
1 
73 I am glad once more to breathe an atmosphere uncontaminated by the fumes
66 and smoke of a city with its population of three hundred thousand
69 inhabitants. In company with our friends Wm. and Ellen Craft, I left
72 Glasgow on the afternoon of the 23d inst., for Dundee, a beautiful town
71 situated on the banks of the river Tay. One like myself, who has spent
73 the best part of an eventful life in cities, and who prefers, as I do, a
63 country to a town life, feels a greater degree of freedom when
69 surrounded by forest trees, or country dwellings, and looking upon a
69 clear sky, than when walking through the thronged thoroughfares of a
71 city, with its dense population, meeting every moment a new or strange
70 face which one has never seen before, and never expects to see again.
72 Although I had met with one of the warmest public receptions with which
68 I have been greeted since my arrival in the country, and had had an
73 opportunity of shaking hands with many noble friends of the slave, whose
65 names I had often seen in print, yet I felt glad to see the tall
69 chimneys and smoke of Glasgow receding in the distance, as our 'iron
69 horse' was taking us with almost lightning speed from the commercial
21 capital of Scotland.
1 
73 The distance from Glasgow to Dundee is some seventy or eighty miles, and
71 we passed through the finest country which I have seen in this portion
70 of the Queen's dominions. We passed through the old town of Stirling,
72 which lies about thirty miles distant from Glasgow, and is a place much
72 frequented by those who travel for pleasure. It is built on the brow of
73 a hill, and the Castle from which it most probably derived its name, may
73 be seen from a distance. Had it not been for a "professional" engagement
73 the same evening at Dundee, I would most assuredly have halted to take a
26 look at the old building.
1 
71 The Castle is situated or built on an isolated rock, which seems as if
72 Nature had thrown it there for that purpose. It was once the retreat of
73 the Scottish Kings, and famous for its historical associations. Here the
73 "Lady of the Lake," with the magic ring, sought the monarch to intercede
70 for her father; here James II. murdered the Earl of Douglas; here the
71 beautiful but unfortunate Mary was made Queen; and here John Knox, the
70 Reformer, preached the coronation sermon of James VI. The Castle Hill
62 rises from the valley of the Forth, and makes an imposing and
73 picturesque appearance. The windings of the noble river till lost in the
64 distance, present pleasing contrasts, scarcely to be surpassed.
1 
70 The speed of our train, after passing Stirling, brought before us, in
71 quick succession, a number of fine valleys and farm houses. Every spot
71 seemed to have been arrayed by Nature for the reception of the cottage
71 of some happy family. During this ride, we passed many sites where the
63 lawns were made, the terraces defined and levelled, the groves
73 tastefully clumped, the ancient trees, though small when compared to our
69 great forest oaks, were beautifully sprinkled here and there, and in
72 everything the labour of art seemed to have been anticipated by Nature.
69 Cincinnatus could not have selected a prettier situation for a farm,
73 than some which presented themselves, during this delightful journey. At
72 last we arrived at the place of our destination, where our friends were
19 in waiting for us.
1 
72 As I have already forwarded to you a paper containing an account of the
66 Dundee meeting, I shall leave you to judge from these reports the
65 character of the demonstration. Yet I must mention a fact or two
73 connected with our first evening's visit to this town. A few hours after
72 our arrival in the place, we were called upon by a gentleman whose name
71 is known wherever the English language is spoken--one whose name is on
72 the tongue of every student and school-boy in this country and America,
64 and what lives upon their lips will live and be loved for ever.
1 
71 We were seated over a cup of strong tea, to revive our spirits for the
71 evening, when our friend entered the room, accompanied by a gentleman,
67 small in stature, and apparently seventy-five years of age, yet he
73 appeared as active as one half that age. Feeling half drowsy from riding
69 in the cold, and then the sudden change to a warm fire, I was rather
70 inclined not to move on the entrance of the stranger. But the name of
69 Thomas Dick, LL.D., roused me in a moment, from my lethargy; I could
62 scarcely believe that I was in the presence of the "Christian
72 Philosopher." Dr. Dick is one of the men to whom the age is indebted. I
72 never find myself in the presence of one to whom the world owes so much
70 as Dr. Dick, without feeling a thrilling emotion, as if I were in the
62 land of spirits. Dr. Dick had come to our lodgings to see and
71 congratulate Wm. and Ellen Craft upon their escape from the republican
67 Christians of the United States; and as he pressed the hand of the
71 "white slave," and bid her "welcome to British soil," I saw the silent
70 tear stealing down the cheek of this man of genius. How I wished that
71 the many slaveholders and pro-slavery professed Christians of America,
71 who have read and pondered the philosophy of this man, could have been
69 present. Thomas Dick is an abolitionist--one who is willing that the
67 world should know that he hates the "peculiar institution." At the
70 meeting that evening, Dr. Dick was among the most prominent. But this
67 was not the only distinguished man who took part on that occasion.
1 
71 Another great mind was on the platform, and entered his solemn protest
70 in a manner long to be remembered by those present. This was the Rev.
73 George Gilfillan, well known as the author of the "Portraits of Literary
69 Men." Mr. Gilfillan is an energetic speaker, and would have been the
71 lion of the evening, even if many others who are more distinguished as
73 platform orators had been present. I think it was Napoleon who said that
70 the enthusiasm of others abated his own. At any rate, the spirit with
72 which each speaker entered upon his duty for the evening, abated my own
69 enthusiasm for the time being. The last day of our stay in Dundee, I
73 paid a visit, by invitation, to Dr. Dick, at his residence in the little
72 village of Broughty Ferry. We found the great astronomer in his parlour
70 waiting for us. From the parlour we went to the new study, and here I
71 felt more at ease, for I went to see the Philosopher in his study, and
69 not in his drawing-room. But even this room had too much the look of
73 nicety to be an author's _sanctum_; and I inquired and was soon informed
62 by Mrs. Dick, that I should have a look at the "_old study_."
1 
69 During a sojourn of eighteen months in Great Britain, I have had the
73 good fortune to meet with several distinguished literary characters, and
70 have always managed, while at their places of abode, to see the table
73 and favourite chair. Wm. and Ellen Craft were seeing what they could see
73 through a microscope, when Mrs. Dick returned to the room, and intimated
69 that we could now see the old literary workshop. I followed, and was
69 soon in a room about fifteen feet square, with but one window, which
71 occupied one side of the room. The walls of the other three sides were
71 lined with books. And many of these looked the very personification of
70 age. I took my seat in the "_old arm chair_;" and here, thought I, is
66 the place and the seat in which this distinguished man sat, while
72 weaving the radiant wreath of renown which now in his old age surrounds
72 him, and whose labours will be more appreciated by future ages than the
9 present.
1 
71 I took a farewell of the author of the "Solar System," but not until I
70 had taken a look through the great telescope in the observatory. This
70 instrument, through which I tried to see the heavens, was not the one
70 invented by Galileo, but an improvement upon the original. On leaving
73 this learned man, he shook hands with us, and bade us "God speed" in our
70 mission; and I left the philosopher, feeling I had not passed an hour
72 more agreeably, with a literary character, since the hour which I spent
69 with Poet Montgomery a few months since. And, by-the-bye, there is a
73 resemblance between the poet and the philosopher. In becoming acquainted
72 with great men, I have become a convert to the opinion, that a big nose
67 is an almost necessary appendage to the form of a man with a giant
71 intellect. If those whom I have seen be a criterion, such is certainly
61 the case. But I have spun out this too long, and must close.

11 LETTER XV.
1 
68 _Melrose Abbey--Abbotsford--Dryburgh Abbey--The Grave of Sir Walter
50 Scott--Hawick--Gretna Green--Visit to the Lakes._
1 
1 
44                     YORK, _March 26, 1851_.
1 
72 I closed my last letter in the ancient town of Melrose, on the banks of
73 the Tweed, and within a stone's throw of the celebrated ruins from which
72 the town derives its name. The valley in which Melrose is situated, and
71 the surrounding hills, together with the Monastery, have so often been
67 made a theme for the Scottish bards, that this has become the most
72 interesting part of Scotland. Of the many gifted writers who have taken
70 up the pen, none have done more to bring the Eildon Hills and Melrose
69 Abbey into note, than the author of "Waverley." But who can read his
73 writings without a regret, that he should have so woven fact and fiction
71 together, that it is almost impossible to discriminate between the one
15 and the other.
1 
72 We arrived at Melrose in the evening, and proceeded to the chapel where
68 our meeting was to be held, and where our friends, the Crafts, were
70 warmly greeted. On returning from the meeting, we passed close by the
73 ruins of Melrose, and, very fortunately, it was a moonlight night. There
73 is considerable difference of opinion among the inhabitants of the place
70 as regards the best time to view the Abbey. The author of the "Lay of
28 the Last Minstrel," says:--
1 
46    "If thou wouldst view fair Melrose aright,
39     Go visit it by the pale moonlight:
39     For the gay beams of lightsome day
39     Gild but to flout the ruins gray."
1 
1 
68 In consequence of this admonition, I was informed that many persons
70 remain in town to see the ruins by moonlight. Aware that the moon did
73 not send its rays upon the old building every night in the year, I asked
70 the keeper what he did on dark nights. He replied that he had a large
68 lantern, which he put upon the end of a long pole, and with this he
67 succeeded in lighting up the ruins. This good man laboured hard to
68 convince me that his invention was nearly, if not quite as good, as
73 Nature's own moon. But having no need of an application of his invention
72 to the Abbey, I had no opportunity of judging of its effect. I thought,
70 however, that he had made a moon to some purpose, when he informed me
72 that some nights, with his pole and lantern, he earned his four or five
72 shillings. Not being content with a view by "moonlight alone," I was up
70 the next morning before the sun, and paid my respects to the Abbey. I
67 was too early for the keeper, and he handed me the key through the
71 window, and I entered the rooms alone. It is one labyrinth of gigantic
71 arches and dilapidated halls, the ivy growing and clinging wherever it
66 can fasten its roots, and the whole as fine a picture of decay as
70 imagination could create. This was the favourite resort of Sir Walter
73 Scott, and furnished him much matter for the "Lay of the Last Minstrel."
69 He could not have selected a more fitting place for solitary thought
69 than this ancient abode of monks and priests. In passing through the
70 cloisters, I could not but remark the carvings of leaves and flowers,
70 wrought in stone in the most exquisite manner, looking as fresh as if
68 they were just from the hands of the artist. The lapse of centuries
66 seems not to have made any impression upon them, or changed their
70 appearance in the least. I sat down among the ruins of the Abbey. The
63 ground about was piled up with magnificent fragments of stone,
69 representing various texts of Scripture, and the quaint ideas of the
72 priests and monks of that age. Scene after scene swept through my fancy
71 as I looked upon the surrounding objects. I could almost imagine I saw
69 the bearded monks going from hall to hall, and from cell to cell. In
72 visiting these dark cells, the mind becomes oppressed by a sense of the
70 utter helplessness of the victims who once passed over the thresholds
70 and entered these religious prisons. There was no help or hope but in
71 the will that ordered their fate. How painful it is to gaze upon these
73 walls, and to think how many tears have been shed by their inmates, when
71 this old Monastery was in its glory. I ascended to the top of the ruin
71 by a circuitous stairway, whose stone steps were worn deep from use by
73 many who, like myself, had visited them to gratify a curiosity. From the
69 top of the Abbey, I had a splendid view of the surrounding hills and
72 the beautiful valley through which flows the Gala Water and Tweed. This
69 is unquestionably the most splendid specimen of Gothic architectural
73 ruin in Scotland. But any description of mine conveys but a poor idea to
44 the fancy. To be realized, it must be seen.
1 
71 During the day, we paid a visit to Abbotsford, the splendid mansion of
72 the late Sir Walter Scott, Bart. This beautiful seat is situated on the
73 banks of the Tweed, just below its junction with the Gala Water. It is a
71 dreary looking spot, and the house from the opposite side of the river
66 has the appearance of a small, low castle. In a single day's ride
63 through England, one may see half a dozen cottages larger than
66 Abbotsford House. I was much disappointed in finding the premises
71 undergoing repairs and alterations, and that all the trees between the
73 house and the river had been cut down. This is to be regretted the more,
70 because they were planted, nearly every one of them, by the same hand
73 that waved its wand of enchantment over the world. The fountain had been
70 removed from where it had been placed by the hands of the Poet to the
73 centre of the yard; and even a small stone that had been placed over the
69 favourite dog "Percy," had been taken up and thrown among some loose
73 stones. One visits Abbotsford because of the genius of the man that once
65 presided over it. Everything connected with the great Poet is of
68 interest to his admirers, and anything altered or removed, tends to
73 diminish that interest. We entered the house, and were conducted through
67 the great Hall, which is hung all round with massive armour of all
68 descriptions, and other memorials of ancient times. The floor is of
73 white and black marble. In passing through the hall, we entered a narrow
70 arched room, stretching quite across the building, having a window at
72 each end. This little or rather narrow room is filled with all kinds of
72 armour, which is arranged with great taste. We were next shown into the
72 Dining-room, whose roof is of black oak, richly carved. In this room is
72 a painting of the head of Queen Mary, in a charger, taken the day after
72 the execution. Many other interesting portraits grace the walls of this
61 room. But by far the finest apartment in the building is the
69 Drawing-room, with a lofty ceiling, and furnished with antique ebony
71 furniture. After passing through the Library, with its twenty thousand
69 volumes, we found ourselves in the Study, and I sat down in the same
72 chair where once sat the Poet; while before me was the table upon which
73 was written the "Lady of the Lake," "Waverley," and other productions of
72 this gifted writer. The clothes last worn by the Poet were shown to us.
73 There was the broad skirted blue coat, with its large buttons, the plaid
72 trousers, the heavy shoes, the black vest and white hat. These were all
73 in a glass case, and all looked the poet and novelist. But the inside of
67 the buildings had undergone alterations as well as the outside. In
73 passing through the Library, we saw a granddaughter of the Poet. She was
72 from London, and was only on a visit of a few days. She looked pale and
70 dejected, and seemed as if she longed to leave this secluded spot and
71 return to the metropolis. She looked for all the world like a hothouse
65 plant. I don't think the Scotch could do better than to purchase
72 Abbotsford, while it has some imprint of the great magician, and secure
70 its preservation; for I am sure that, a hundred years hence, no place
70 will be more frequently visited in Scotland than the home of the late
69 Sir Walter Scott. After sauntering three hours about the premises, I
71 left, but not without feeling that I had been well paid for my trouble
24 in visiting Abbotsford.
1 
71 In the afternoon of the same day, in company with the Crafts, I took a
68 drive to Dryburgh Abbey. It is a ruin of little interest, except as
68 being the burial place of Scott. The poet lies buried in St. Mary's
68 Aisle. His grave is in the left transept of the cross, and close to
68 where the high altar formerly stood. Sir Walter Scott chose his own
70 grave, and he could not have selected a sunnier spot if he had roamed
73 the wide world over. A shaded window breaks the sun as it falls upon his
72 grave. The ivy is creeping and clinging wherever it can, as if it would
71 shelter the poet's grave from the weather. The author lies between his
71 wife and eldest son, and there is only room enough for one grave more,
56 and the son's wife has the choice of being buried here.
1 
72 The four o'clock train took us to Hawick; and after a pleasant visit in
68 this place, and the people registering their names against American
71 Slavery, and the Fugitive Bill in particular, we set out for Carlisle,
71 passing through the antique town of Langholm. After leaving the latter
73 place, we had to travel by coach. But no matter how one travels here, he
73 travels at a more rapid rate than in America. The distance from Langholm
69 to Carlisle, twenty miles, occupied only two and a-half hours in the
68 journey. It was a cold day and I had to ride on the outside, as the
69 inside had been taken up. We changed horses, and took in and put out
71 passengers with a rapidity which seems almost incredible. The road was
23 as smooth as a mirror.
1 
69 We bid farewell to Scotland, as we reached the little town of Gretna
68 Green. This town being on the line between England and Scotland, is
71 noted as the place where a little cross-eyed, red-faced blacksmith, by
71 the name of Priestly, first set up his own altar to Hymen, and married
73 all who came to him, without regard to rank or station, and at prices to
71 suit all. It was worth a ride through this part of the country, if for
71 no other purpose than to see the town where more clandestine marriages
73 have taken place than in any other part in the world. A ride of eight or
67 nine miles brought us in sight of the Eden, winding its way slowly
68 through a beautiful valley, with farms on either side, covered with
71 sheep and cattle. Four very tall chimneys, sending forth dense columns
73 of black smoke, announced to us that we were near Carlisle. I was really
70 glad of this, for Ulysses was never more tired of the shores of Ilion
33 than I of the top of that coach.
1 
72 We remained over night at Carlisle, partaking of the hospitality of the
70 prince of bakers, and left the next day for the Lakes, where we had a
71 standing invitation to pay a visit to a distinguished literary lady. A
62 cold ride of about fifty miles brought us to the foot of Lake
69 Windermere, a beautiful sheet of water, surrounded by mountains that
73 seemed to vie with each other which should approach nearest the sky. The
65 margin of the lake is carved out and built up into terrace above
73 terrace, until the slopes and windings are lost in the snow-capped peaks
65 of the mountains. It is not surprising that such men as Southey,
63 Coleridge, Wordsworth, and others, resorted to this region for
70 inspiration. After a coach ride of five miles (passing on our journey
70 the "Dove's Nest," home of the late Mrs. Hemans), we were put down at
69 the door of the Salutation Hotel, Ambleside, and a few minutes after
73 found ourselves under the roof of the authoress of "Society in America."
72 I know not how it is with others, but for my own part, I always form an
66 opinion of the appearance of an author whose writings I am at all
73 familiar with, or a statesman whose speeches I have read. I had pictured
73 in my own mind a tall, stately-looking lady of about sixty years, as the
71 authoress of "Travels in the East," and for once I was right, with the
67 single exception that I had added on too many years by twelve. The
72 evening was spent in talking about the United States; and William Craft
67 had to go through the narrative of his escape from slavery. When I
71 retired for the night, I found it almost impossible to sleep. The idea
70 that I was under the roof of the authoress of "The Hour and the Man,"
67 and that I was on the banks of the sweetest lake in Great Britain,
71 within half a mile of the residence of the late poet Wordsworth, drove
69 sleep from my pillow. But I must leave an account of my visit to the
27 Lakes for a future letter.
1 
69 When I look around and see the happiness here, even among the poorer
70 classes, and that too in a country where the soil is not at all to be
72 compared with our own, I mourn for our down-trodden countrymen, who are
70 plundered, oppressed, and made chattels of, to enable an ostentatious
61 aristocracy to vie with each other in splendid extravagance.

12 LETTER XVI.
1 
73 _Miss Martineau--"The Knoll"--"Ridal Mount"--"The Dove's Nest"--Grave of
48 William Wordsworth, Esq.--The English Peasant._
1 
1 
36                     _May 30, 1851_.
1 
65 A series of public meetings, one pressing close upon the heel of
70 another, must be an apology for my six or eight weeks' silence. But I
73 hope that no temporary suspense on my part will be construed into a want
73 of interest in our cause, or a wish to desist from giving occasionally a
43 scrap (such as it is) to the _North Star_.
1 
73 My last letter left me under the hospitable roof of Harriet Martineau. I
69 had long had an invitation to visit this distinguished friend of our
67 race, and as the invitation was renewed during my tour through the
66 North, I did not feel disposed to decline it, and thereby lose so
73 favourable an opportunity of meeting with one who had written so much in
72 behalf of the oppressed of our land. About a mile from the head of Lake
71 Windermere, and immediately under Wonsfell, and encircled by mountains
73 on all sides, except the south-west, lies the picturesque little town of
67 Ambleside, and the brightest spot in the place is "The Knoll," the
29 residence of Miss Martineau.
1 
72 We reached "The Knoll" a little after nightfall, and a cordial shake of
73 the hand by Miss M., who was waiting for us, soon assured us that we had
24 met with a warm friend.
1 
71 It is not my intention to lay open the scenes of domestic life at "The
69 Knoll," nor to describe the social parties of which my friends and I
70 were partakers during our sojourn within the hospitable walls of this
73 distinguished writer; but the name of Miss M. is so intimately connected
70 with the Anti-slavery movement, by her early writings, and those have
71 been so much admired by the friends of the slave in the United States,
73 that I deem it not at all out of place for me to give the readers of the
73 _North Star_ some idea of the authoress of "Political Economy," "Travels
42 in the East," "The Hour and the Man," &c.
1 
70 The dwelling is a cottage of moderate size, built after Miss M.'s own
73 plan, upon a rise of land from which it derives the name of "The Knoll."
71 The Library is the largest room in the building, and upon the walls of
72 it were hung some beautiful engravings and a continental map. On a long
63 table which occupied the centre of the room, were the busts of
70 Shakspere, Newton, Milton, and a few other literary characters of the
73 past. One side of the room was taken up with a large case, filled with a
69 choice collection of books, and everything indicated that it was the
29 home of genius and of taste.
1 
68 The room usually occupied by Miss M., and where we found her on the
65 evening of our arrival, is rather small and lighted by two large
68 windows. The walls of this room were also decorated with prints and
72 pictures, and on the mantle-shelf were some models in _terra cottia_ of
73 Italian groups. On a circular table lay casts, medallions, and some very
73 choice water-colour drawings. Under the south window stood a small table
70 covered with newly opened letters, a portfolio and several new books,
67 with here and there a page turned down, and one with a paper knife
72 between its leaves as if it had only been half read. I took up the last
62 mentioned, and it proved to be the "Life and Poetry of Hartly
72 Coleridge," son of S.T. Coleridge. It was just from the press, and had,
72 a day or two before, been forwarded to her by the publisher. Miss M. is
73 very deaf and always carries in her left hand a trumpet; and I was not a
69 little surprised on learning from her that she had never enjoyed the
70 sense of smell, and only on one occasion the sense of taste, and that
69 for a single moment. Miss M. is loved with a sort of idolatry by the
66 people of Ambleside, and especially the poor, to whom she gives a
68 course of lectures every winter gratuitously. She finished her last
67 course the day before our arrival. She was much pleased with Ellen
70 Craft, and appeared delighted with the story of herself and husband's
69 escape from slavery, as related by the latter--during the recital of
71 which I several times saw the silent tear stealing down her cheek, and
41 which she tried in vain to hide from us.
1 
73 When Craft had finished, she exclaimed, "I would that every woman in the
72 British Empire, could hear that tale as I have, so that they might know
73 how their own sex was treated in that boasted land of liberty." It seems
73 strange to the people of this county, that one so white and so lady-like
72 as Mrs. Craft, should have been a slave and forced to leave the land of
72 her nativity and seek an asylum in a foreign country. The morning after
67 our arrival, I took a stroll by a circuitous pathway to the top of
67 Loughrigg Fell. At the foot of the mount I met a peasant, who very
73 kindly offered to lend me his donkey, upon which to ascend the mountain.
70 Never having been upon the back of one of these long eared animals, I
72 felt some hesitation about trusting myself upon so diminutive looking a
70 creature. But being assured that if I would only resign myself to his
73 care and let him have his own way, I would be perfectly safe, I mounted,
68 and off we set. We had, however, scarcely gone fifty rods, when, in
73 passing over a narrow part of the path and overlooking a deep chasm, one
73 of the hind feet of the donkey slipped, and with an involuntary shudder,
68 I shut my eyes to meet my expected doom; but fortunately the little
72 fellow gained his foothold, and in all probability saved us both from a
66 premature death. After we had passed over this dangerous place, I
73 dismounted, and as soon as my feet had once more gained _terra firma_, I
71 resolved that I would never again yield my own judgment to that of any
27 one, not even to a donkey.
1 
69 It seems as if Nature has amused herself in throwing these mountains
73 together. From the top of the Loughrigg Fell, the eye loses its power in
65 gazing upon the objects below. On our left, lay Rydal Mount, the
73 beautiful seat of the late poet Wordsworth. While to the right, and away
72 in the dim distance, almost hidden by the native trees, was the cottage
69 where once resided Mrs. Hemans. And below us lay Windermere, looking
71 more like a river than a lake, and which, if placed by the side of our
72 own Ontario, Erie or Huron, would be lost in the fog. But here it looks
70 beautiful in the extreme, surrounded as it is by a range of mountains
69 that have no parallel in the United States for beauty. Amid a sun of
72 uncommon splendour, dazzling the eye with the reflection upon the water
72 below, we descended into the valley, and I was soon again seated by the
73 fireside of our hospitable hostess. In the afternoon of the same day, we
69 took a drive to the "Dove's Nest," the home of the late Mrs. Hemans.
1 
73 We did not see the inside of the house, on account of its being occupied
73 by a very eccentric man, who will not permit a woman to enter the house,
63 and it is said that he has been known to run when a female had
73 unconsciously intruded herself upon his premises. And as our company was
70 in part composed of ladies, we had to share their fate, and therefore
64 were prevented from seeing the interior of the Dove's Nest. The
69 exhibitor of such a man would be almost sure of a prize at the great
12 Exhibition.
1 
72 At the head of Grassmere Lake, and surrounded by a few cottages, stands
72 an old gray, antique-looking Parish Church, venerable with the lapse of
69 centuries, and the walls partly covered with ivy, and in the rear of
70 which is the parish burial-ground. After leaving the Dove's Nest, and
69 having a pleasant ride over the hills and between the mountains, and
72 just as the sun was disappearing behind them, we arrived at the gate of
69 Grassmere Church; and alighting and following Miss M., we soon found
69 ourselves standing over a grave, marked by a single stone, and that,
70 too, very plain, with a name deeply cut. This announced to us that we
69 were standing over the grave of William Wordsworth. He chose his own
72 grave, and often visited the spot before his death. He lies in the most
72 sequestered spot in the whole grounds, and the simplicity and beauty of
73 the place was enough to make one in love with it, to be laid so far from
71 the bustle of the world, and in so sweet a place. The more one becomes
71 acquainted with the literature of the old world, the more he must love
73 her poets. Among the teachers of men, none are more worthy of study than
73 the poets; and, as teachers, they should receive far more credit than is
63 yielded to them. No one can look back upon the lives of Dante,
71 Shakspere, Milton, Goethe, Cowper, and many others that we might name,
70 without being reminded of the sacrifices which they made for mankind,
70 and which were not appreciated until long after their deaths. We need
72 look no farther than our own country to find men and women wielding the
72 pen practically and powerfully for the right. It is acknowledged on all
69 hands in this country, that England has the greatest dead poets, and
71 America the greatest living ones. The poet and the true Christian have
73 alike a hidden life. Worship is the vital element of each. Poetry has in
72 it that kind of utility which good men find in their Bible, rather than
71 such convenience as bad men often profess to draw from it. It ennobles
70 the sentiments, enlarges the affections, kindles the imagination, and
71 gives to us the enjoyment of a life in the past, and in the future, as
69 well as in the present. Under its light and warmth, we wake from our
69 torpidity and coldness, to a sense of our capabilities. This impulse
71 once given, a great object is gained. Schiller has truly said, "Poetry
72 can be to a man, what love is to a hero. It can neither counsel him nor
73 smite him, nor perform any labour for him, but it can bring him up to be
70 a hero, can summon him to deeds, and arm him with strength for all he
70 ought to be." I have often read with pleasure the sweet poetry of our
70 own Whitfield of Buffalo, which has appeared from time to time in the
73 columns of the _North Star_. I have always felt ashamed of the fact that
67 he should be compelled to wield the razor instead of the pen for a
70 living. Meaner poets than James M. Whitfield, are now living by their
66 compositions; and were he a white man he would occupy a different
10 position.
1 
72 After remaining a short time, and reading the epitaphs of the departed,
72 we again returned to "The Knoll." Nothing can be more imposing than the
70 beauty of English park scenery, and especially in the vicinity of the
70 lakes. Magnificent lawns that extend like sheets of vivid green, with
68 here and there a sprinkling of fine trees, heaping up rich piles of
71 foliage, and then the forests with the hare, the deer, and the rabbit,
72 bounding away to the covert, or the pheasant suddenly bursting upon the
65 wing--the artificial stream, the brook taught to wind in natural
66 meanderings, or expand into the glassy lake, with the yellow leaf
69 sleeping upon its bright waters, and occasionally a rustic temple or
73 sylvan statue grown green and dark with age, give an air of sanctity and
68 picturesque beauty to English scenery that is unknown in the United
71 States. The very labourer with his thatched cottage and narrow slip of
73 ground-plot before the door, the little flower-bed, the woodbine trimmed
70 against the wall, and hanging its blossoms about the windows, and the
71 peasant seen trudging home at nightfall with the avails of the toil of
71 the day upon his back--all this tells us of the happiness both of rich
69 and poor in this country. And yet there are those who would have the
71 world believe that the labourer of England is in a far worse condition
66 than the slaves of America. Such persons know nothing of the real
72 condition of the working classes of this country. At any rate, the poor
71 here, as well as the rich, are upon a level, as far as the laws of the
72 country are concerned. The more one becomes acquainted with the English
72 people, the more one has to admire them. They are so different from the
72 people of our own country. Hospitality, frankness, and good humour, are
72 always to be found in an Englishman. After a ramble of three days about
70 the lakes, we mounted the coach, bidding Miss Martineau farewell, and
27 quitted the lake district.

31 _A Day in the Crystal Palace._
1 
1 
47                     LONDON, _June 27th, 1851_.
1 
73 Presuming that you will expect from me some account of the great World's
73 Fair, I take my pen to give you my own impressions, although I am afraid
70 that anything which I may say about this "Lion of the day," will fall
72 far short of a description. On Monday last, I quitted my lodgings at an
72 early hour, and started for the Crystal Palace. This day was fine, such
70 as we seldom experience in London, with a clear sky, and invigorating
70 air, whose vitality was as rousing to the spirits as a blast from the
70 "horn of Astolpho." Although it was not yet 10 o'clock when I entered
71 Piccadilly, every omnibus was full, inside and out, and the street was
73 lined with one living stream, as far as the eye could reach, all wending
73 their way to the "Glass-House." No metropolis in the world presents such
68 facilities as London for the reception of the Great Exhibition, now
72 collected within its walls. Throughout its myriads of veins, the stream
70 of industry and toil pulses with sleepless energy. Every one seems to
72 feel that this great Capital of the world, is the fittest place wherein
71 they might offer homage to the dignity of toil. I had already begun to
73 feel fatigued by my pedestrian excursion as I passed "Apsley House," the
65 residence of the Duke of Wellington, and emerged into Hyde Park.
1 
71 I had hoped that on getting into the Park, I would be out of the crowd
65 that seemed to press so heavily in the street. But in this I was
63 mistaken. I here found myself surrounded by and moving with an
70 overwhelming mass, such as I had never before witnessed. And, away in
72 the distance, I beheld a dense crowd, and above every other object, was
71 seen the lofty summit of the Crystal Palace. The drive in the Park was
71 lined with princely-looking vehicles of every description. The drivers
70 in their bright red and gold uniforms, the pages and footmen in their
69 blue trousers and white silk stockings, and the horses dressed up in
69 their neat, silver-mounted harness, made the scene altogether one of
71 great splendour. I was soon at the door, paid my shilling, and entered
68 the building at the south end of the Transept. For the first ten or
71 twenty minutes I was so lost in astonishment, and absorbed in pleasing
70 wonder, that I could do nothing but gaze up and down the vista of the
67 noble building. The Crystal Palace resembles in some respects, the
73 interior of the cathedrals of this country. One long avenue from east to
71 west is intersected by a Transept, which divides the building into two
70 nearly equal parts. This is the greatest building the world ever saw,
68 before which the Pyramids of Egypt, and the Colossus of Rhodes must
72 hide their diminished heads. The palace was not full at any time during
68 the day, there being only 64,000 persons present. Those who love to
68 study the human countenance in all its infinite varieties, can find
73 ample scope for the indulgence of their taste, by a visit to the World's
64 Fair. All countries are there represented--Europeans, Asiatics,
67 Americans and Africans, with their numerous subdivisions. Even the
73 exclusive Chinese, with his hair braided, and hanging down his back, has
71 left the land of his nativity, and is seen making long strides through
67 the Crystal Palace, in his wooden-bottomed shoes. Of all places of
69 curious costumes and different fashions, none has ever yet presented
72 such a variety as this Exhibition. No dress is too absurd to be worn in
12 this place.
1 
68 There is a great deal of freedom in the Exhibition. The servant who
67 walks behind his mistress through the Park feels that he can crowd
67 against her in the Exhibition. The Queen and the day labourer, the
67 Prince and the merchant, the peer and the pauper, the Celt and the
71 Saxon, the Greek and the Frank, the Hebrew and the Russ, all meet here
71 upon terms of perfect equality. This amalgamation of rank, this kindly
68 blending of interests, and forgetfulness of the cold formalities of
71 ranks and grades, cannot but be attended with the very best results. I
72 was pleased to see such a goodly sprinkling of my own countrymen in the
68 Exhibition--I mean coloured men and women--well-dressed, and moving
64 about with their fairer brethren. This, some of our pro-slavery
73 Americans did not seem to relish very well. There was no help for it. As
70 I walked through the American part of the Crystal Palace, some of our
72 Virginian neighbours eyed me closely and with jealous looks, especially
71 as an English lady was leaning on my arm. But their sneering looks did
72 not disturb me in the least. I remained the longer in their department,
71 and criticised the bad appearance of their goods the more. Indeed, the
72 Americans, as far as appearance goes, are behind every other country in
70 the Exhibition. The "Greek Slave" is the only production of Art which
72 the United States has sent. And it would have been more to their credit
71 had they kept that at home. In so vast a place as the Great Exhibition
73 one scarcely knows what to visit first, or what to look upon last. After
71 wandering about through the building for five hours, I sat down in one
73 of the galleries and looked at the fine marble statue of Virginius, with
68 the knife in his hand and about to take the life of his beloved and
71 beautiful daughter, to save her from the hands of Appius Claudius. The
67 admirer of genius will linger for hours among the great variety of
70 statues in the long avenue. Large statues of Lords Eldon and Stowell,
71 carved out of solid marble, each weighing above twenty tons, are among
35 the most gigantic in the building.
1 
71 I was sitting with my 400 paged guide-book before me, and looking down
71 upon the moving mass, when my attention was called to a small group of
68 gentlemen standing near the statue of Shakspere, one of whom wore a
70 white coat and hat, and had flaxen hair, and trousers rather short in
70 the legs. The lady by my side, and who had called my attention to the
73 group, asked if I could tell what country this odd-looking gentleman was
70 from? Not wishing to run the risk of a mistake, I was about declining
72 to venture an opinion, when the reflection of the sun against a mirror,
66 on the opposite side, threw a brilliant light upon the group, and
65 especially on the face of the gentleman in the white coat, and I
72 immediately recognized under the brim of the white hat, the features of
72 Horace Greeley, Esq., of the New York "Tribune." His general appearance
73 was as much out of the English style as that of the Turk whom I had seen
70 but a moment before--in his bag-like trousers, shuffling along in his
69 slippers. But oddness in dress, is one of the characteristics of the
18 Great Exhibition.
1 
66 Among the many things in the Crystal Palace, there are some which
71 receive greater attention than others, around which may always be seen
72 large groups of the visitors. The first of these is the Koh-i-noor, the
70 "Mountain of Light." This is the largest and most valuable diamond in
70 the world, said to be worth £2,000,000 sterling. It is indeed a great
69 source of attraction to those who go to the Exhibition for the first
72 time, but it is doubtful whether it obtains such admiration afterwards.
70 We saw more than one spectator turn away with the idea that after all
70 it was only a piece of glass. After some jamming, I got a look at the
70 precious jewel, and although in a brass-grated cage, strong enough to
71 hold a lion, I found it to be no larger than the third of a hen's egg.
48 Two policemen remain by its side day and night.
1 
72 The finest thing in the Exhibition, is the "Veiled Vestal," a statue of
73 a woman carved in marble, with a veil over her face, and so neatly done,
71 that it looks as if it had been thrown over after it was finished. The
70 Exhibition presents many things which appeal to the eye and touch the
70 heart, and altogether, it is so decorated and furnished, as to excite
51 the dullest mind, and satisfy the most fastidious.
1 
66 England has contributed the most useful and substantial articles;
71 France, the most beautiful; while Russia, Turkey, and the West Indies,
66 seem to vie with each other in richness. China and Persia are not
73 behind. Austria has also contributed a rich and beautiful stock. Sweden,
69 Norway, Denmark, and the smaller states of Europe, have all tried to
69 outdo themselves in sending goods to the World's Fair. In Machinery,
65 England has no competitor. In Art, France is almost alone in the
35 Exhibition, setting aside England.
1 
67 In natural productions and provisions, America stands alone in her
72 glory. There lies her pile of canvassed hams; whether they were wood or
72 real, we could not tell. There are her barrels of salt, beef, and pork,
70 her beautiful white lard, her Indian-corn and corn-meal, her rice and
69 tobacco, her beef tongues, dried peas, and a few bags of cotton. The
71 contributors from the United States seemed to have forgotten that this
69 was an exhibition of Art, or they most certainly would not have sent
71 provisions. But the United States takes the lead in the contributions,
73 as no other country has sent in provisions. The finest thing contributed
71 by our countrymen, is a large piece of silk with an eagle painted upon
37 it, surrounded by stars and stripes.
1 
70 After remaining more than five hours in the great temple, I turned my
69 back upon the richly laden stalls and left the Crystal Palace. On my
68 return home I was more fortunate than in the morning, inasmuch as I
70 found a seat for my friend and myself in an omnibus. And even my ride
72 in the close omnibus was not without interest. For I had scarcely taken
68 my seat, when my friend, who was seated opposite me, with looks and
71 gesture informed me that we were in the presence of some distinguished
71 person. I eyed the countenances of the different persons, but in vain,
69 to see if I could find any one who by his appearance showed signs of
67 superiority over his fellow-passengers. I had given up the hope of
71 selecting the person of note when another look from my friend directed
72 my attention to a gentlemen seated in the corner of the omnibus. He was
70 a tall man with strongly marked features, hair dark and coarse. There
71 was a slight stoop of the shoulder--that bend which is almost always a
67 characteristic of studious men. But he wore upon his countenance a
73 forbidding and disdainful frown, that seemed to tell one that he thought
73 himself better than those about him. His dress did not indicate a man of
69 high rank; and had we been in America, I would have taken him for an
13 Ohio farmer.
1 
64 While I was scanning the features and general appearance of the
65 gentleman, the Omnibus stopped and put down three or four of the
71 passengers, which gave me an opportunity of getting a seat by the side
73 of my friend, who, in a low whisper, informed me that the gentleman whom
72 I had been eyeing so closely, was no less a person than Thomas Carlyle.
72 I had read his "Hero-worship," and "Past and Present," and had formed a
71 high opinion of his literary abilities. But his recent attack upon the
68 emancipated people of the West Indies, and his laborious article in
71 favour of the re-establishment of the lash and slavery, had created in
70 my mind a dislike for the man, and I almost regretted that we were in
72 the same Omnibus. In some things, Mr. Carlyle is right: but in many, he
68 is entirely wrong. As a writer, Mr. Carlyle is often monotonous and
64 extravagant. He does not exhibit a new view of nature, or raise
71 insignificant objects into importance, but generally takes commonplace
73 thoughts and events, and tries to express them in stronger and statelier
70 language than others. He holds no communion with his kind, but stands
72 alone without mate or fellow. He is like a solitary peak, all access to
66 which is cut off. He exists not by sympathy but by antipathy. Mr.
70 Carlyle seems chiefly to try how he shall display his own powers, and
73 astonish mankind, by starting new trains of speculation or by expressing
73 old ones so as not to be understood. He cares little what he says, so as
72 he can say it differently from others. To read his works, is one thing;
73 to understand them, is another. If any one thinks that I exaggerate, let
73 him sit for an hour over "Sartor Resartus," and if he does not rise from
72 its pages, place his three or four dictionaries on the shelf, and say I
73 am right, I promise never again to say a word against Thomas Carlyle. He
71 writes one page in favour of Reform, and ten against it. He would hang
69 all prisoners to get rid of them, yet the inmates of the prisons and
72 "work-houses are better off than the poor." His heart is with the poor;
70 yet the blacks of the West Indies should be taught, that if they will
71 not raise sugar and cotton by their own free will, "Quashy should have
71 the whip applied to him." He frowns upon the Reformatory speakers upon
71 the boards of Exeter Hall, yet he is the prince of reformers. He hates
72 heroes and assassins, yet Cromwell was an angel, and Charlotte Corday a
68 saint. He scorns everything, and seems to be tired of what he is by
67 nature, and tries to be what he is not. But you will ask, what has
71 Thomas Carlyle to do with a visit to the Crystal Palace? My only reply
71 is, "Nothing," and if my remarks upon him have taken up the space that
72 should have been devoted to the Exhibition, and what I have written not
69 prove too burdensome to read, my next will be "a week in the Crystal
9 Palace."

67 _The London Peace Congress--Meeting of Fugitive Slaves--Temperance
50 Demonstration--The Great Exhibition: last visit._
1 
1 
41                     LONDON, _August 20_.
1 
64 The past six weeks have been of a stirring nature in this great
69 metropolis. It commenced with the Peace Congress, the proceedings of
70 which have long since reached you. And although that event has passed
73 off, it may not be out of place here to venture a remark or two upon its
15 deliberations.
1 
72 A meeting upon the subject of Peace, with the support of the monied and
73 influential men who rally around the Peace standard, could scarcely have
73 been held in Exeter Hall without creating some sensation. From all parts
70 of the world flocked delegates to this practical protest against war.
70 And among those who took part in the proceedings, were many men whose
69 names alone would, even on ordinary occasions, have filled the great
69 hall. The speakers were chosen from among the representatives of the
73 various countries, without regard to dialect or complexion; and the only
69 fault which seemed to be found with the Committee's arrangement was,
70 that in their desire to get foreigners and Londoners, they forgot the
70 country delegates, so that none of the large provincial towns were at
67 all represented in the Congress, so far as speaking was concerned.
70 Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and all the important towns in Scotland
69 and Ireland, were silenced in the great meeting. I need not say that
73 this was an oversight of the Committee, and one, too, that has done some
72 injury. Such men as the able Chairman of the late Anti-Corn Law League,
71 cannot be forgotten in such a meeting, without giving offence to those
71 who sent him, especially when the Committee brought forward, day after
73 day, the same speakers, chosen from amongst the metropolitan delegation.
69 However, the meeting was a glorious one, and will long be remembered
63 with delight as a step onward in the cause of Peace. Burritt's
72 Brotherhood Bazaar followed close upon the heels of the Peace Congress;
70 and this had scarcely closed, when that ever-memorable meeting of the
61 American Fugitive Slaves took place in the Hall of Commerce.
1 
72 The Temperance people made the next reformatory move. This meeting took
68 place in Exeter Hall, and was made up of delegates from the various
68 towns in the kingdom. They had come from the North, East, West, and
68 South. There was the quick-spoken son of the Emerald Isle, with his
73 pledge suspended from his neck; there, too, the Scot, speaking his broad
71 dialect; also the representatives from the provincial towns of England
58 and Wales, who seemed to speak anything but good English.
1 
65 The day after the meeting had closed in Exeter Hall, the country
68 societies, together with those of the metropolis, assembled in Hyde
73 Park, and then walked to the Crystal Palace. Their number while going to
70 the Exhibition, was variously estimated at from 15,000 to 20,000, and
64 was said to have been the largest gathering of Teetotalers ever
68 assembled in London. They consisted chiefly of the working classes,
68 their wives and children--clean, well-dressed and apparently happy:
71 their looks indicating in every way those orderly habits which, beyond
66 question, distinguish the devotees of that cause above the common
68 labourers of this country. On arriving at the Exhibition, they soon
70 distributed themselves among the departments, to revel in its various
73 wonders, eating their own lunch, and drinking from the Crystal Fountain.
1 
70 And now I am at the world's wonder, I will remain here until I finish
66 this sheet. I have spent fifteen days in the Exhibition, and have
67 conversed with those who have spent double that number amongst its
71 beauties, and the general opinion appears to be, that six months would
72 not be too long to remain within its walls to enable one to examine its
72 laden stalls. Many persons make the Crystal Palace their home, with the
68 exception of night. I have seen them come in the morning, visit the
64 dressing-room, then go to the refreshment room, and sit down to
70 breakfast as if they had been at their hotel. Dinner and tea would be
15 taken in turn.
1 
70 The Crystal Fountain is the great place of meeting in the Exhibition.
68 There you may see husbands looking for lost wives, wives for stolen
70 husbands, mothers for their lost children, and towns-people for their
71 country friends; and unless you have an appointment at a certain place
69 at an hour, you might as well prowl through the streets of London to
72 find a friend, as in the Great Exhibition. There is great beauty in the
72 "Glass House." Here, in the transept, with the glorious sunlight coming
67 through that wonderful glass roof, may the taste be cultivated and
62 improved, the mind edified, and the feelings chastened. Here,
72 surrounded by noble creations in marble and bronze, and in the midst of
72 an admiring throng, one may gaze at statuary which might fitly decorate
49 the house of the proudest prince in Christendom.
1 
71 He who takes his station in the gallery, at either end, and looks upon
69 that wondrous nave, or who surveys the matchless panorama around him
69 from the intersection of the nave and transept, may be said, without
71 presumption or exaggeration, to see all the kingdoms of this world and
65 the glory of them. He sees not only a greater collection of fine
71 articles, but also a greater as well as more various assemblage of the
58 human race, than ever before was gathered under one roof.
1 
73 One of the beauties of this great international gathering is, that it is
66 not confined to rank or grade. The million toilers from mine, and
73 factory, and workshop, and loom, and office, and field, share with their
71 more wealthy neighbours the feast of reason and imagination spread out
23 in the Crystal Palace.
1 
70 It is strange indeed to see so many nations assembled and represented
71 on one spot of British ground. In short, it is one great theatre, with
70 thousands of performers, each playing his own part. England is there,
67 with her mighty engines toiling and whirring, indefatigable in her
68 enterprises to shorten labour. India spreads her glitter and paint.
68 France, refined and fastidious, is there every day, giving the last
71 touch to her picturesque group; and the other countries, each in their
71 turn, doing what they can to show off. The distant hum of thousands of
68 good humoured people, with occasionally a national anthem from some
72 gigantic organ, together with the noise of the machinery, seems to send
44 life into every part of the Crystal Palace.
1 
63 When you get tired of walking, you can sit down and write your
73 impressions, and there is the "post" to receive your letter, or if it be
71 Friday or Saturday, you may, if you choose, rest yourself by hearing a
71 lecture from Professor Anstead; and then before leaving take your last
73 look, and see something that you have not before seen. Every thing which
70 is old in cities, new in colonial life, splendid in courts, useful in
67 industry, beautiful in nature, or ingenious in invention, is there
72 represented. In one place we have the Bible translated into one hundred
72 and fifty languages; in another, we have saints and archbishops painted
67 on glass; in another, old palaces and the altars of a John Knox, a
66 Baxter, or some other divines of olden time. In the old Temple of
73 Delphi, we read that every state of the civilized world had its separate
72 treasury, where Herodotus, born two thousand years before his time, saw
72 and observed all kinds of prodigies in gold and silver, brass and iron,
71 and even in linen. The nations all met there on one common ground, and
65 the peace of the earth was not a little promoted by their common
70 interest in the sanctity and splendour of that shrine. As long as the
72 Exhibition lasts, and its memory endures, we hope and trust that it may
68 shed the same influence. With this hasty scrap, I take leave of the
18 Great Exhibition.

1 
1 
52                     OXFORD, _September 10th, 1851_.
1 
68 I have just finished a short visit to the far famed city of Oxford,
71 which has not unaptly been styled the City of Palaces. Aside from this
65 being one of the principal seats of learning in the world, it is
69 distinguished alike for its religious and political changes in times
61 past. At one time it was the seat of Popery; at another, the
71 uncompromising enemy of Rome. Here the tyrant, Richard the Third, held
68 his court, and when James the First, and his son Charles the First,
70 found their capital too hot to hold them, they removed to their loyal
64 city of Oxford. The writings of the great Republicans were here
68 committed to the flames. At one time Popery sent Protestants to the
69 stake and faggot; at another, a Papist King found no favour with the
72 people. A noble monument now stands where Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer,
73 proclaimed their sentiments and faith, and sealed them with their blood.
73 And now we read upon the Town Treasurer's book--for three loads of wood,
70 one load of faggots, one post, two chains and staples, to burn Ridley
73 and Latimer, £1 5s. 1d. Such is the information one gets by looking over
50 the records of books written three centuries ago.
1 
68 It was a beautiful day on which I arrived at Oxford, and instead of
72 remaining in my hotel, I sallied forth to take a survey of the beauties
72 of the city. I strolled into Christ Church Meadows, and there spent the
70 evening in viewing the numerous halls of learning which surround that
68 splendid promenade. And fine old buildings they are: centuries have
72 rolled over many of them, hallowing the old walls, and making them grey
64 with age. They have been for ages the chosen homes of piety and
73 philosophy. Heroes and scholars have gone forth from their studies here,
66 into the great field of the world, to seek their fortunes, and to
70 conquer and be conquered. As I surveyed the exterior of the different
70 Colleges, I could here and there see the reflection of the light from
69 the window of some student, who was busy at his studies, or throwing
71 away his time over some trashy novel, too many of which find their way
67 into the trunks or carpet bags of the young men on setting out for
73 College. As I looked upon the walls of these buildings, I thought as the
71 rough stone is taken from the quarry to the finisher, there to be made
70 into an ornament, so was the young mind brought here to be cultivated
73 and developed. Many a poor unobtrusive young man, with the appearance of
72 little or no ability, is here moulded into a hero, a scholar, a tyrant,
73 or a friend of humanity. I never look upon these monuments of education,
68 without a feeling of regret, that so few of our own race can find a
71 place within their walls. And this being the fact, I see more and more
69 the need of our people being encouraged to turn their attention more
69 seriously to self-education, and thus to take a respectable position
68 before the world, by virtue of their own cultivated minds and moral
10 standing.
1 
70 Education, though obtained by a little at a time, and that, too, over
70 the midnight lamp, will place its owner in a position to be respected
69 by all, even though he be black. I know that the obstacles which the
69 laws of the land, and of society, place between the coloured man and
71 education in the United States, are very great, yet if _one_ can break
73 through these barriers, more can; and if our people would only place the
71 right appreciation upon education, they would find these obstacles are
68 easier to be overcome than at first sight appears. A young man once
71 asked Carlyle, what was the secret of success. His reply was, "Energy;
72 whatever you undertake, do it with all your might." Had it not been for
73 the possession of energy, I might now have been working as a servant for
70 some brainless fellow who might be able to command my labour with his
67 money, or I might have been yet toiling in chains and slavery. But
73 thanks to energy, not only for my being to-day in a land of freedom, but
70 also for my dear girls being in one of the best seminaries in France,
72 instead of being in an American school, where the finger of scorn would
72 be pointed at them by those whose superiority rests entirely upon their
68 having a whiter skin. But I am straying too far from the purpose of
13 this letter.
1 
70 Oxford is indeed one of the finest located places in the kingdom, and
60 every inch of ground about it seems hallowed by interesting
69 associations. The University, founded by the good King Alfred, still
69 throws its shadow upon the side-walk; and the lapse of ten centuries
65 seems to have made but little impression upon it. Other seats of
66 learning may be entitled to our admiration, but Oxford claims our
72 veneration. Although the lateness of the night compelled me, yet I felt
66 an unwillingness to tear myself from the scene of such surpassing
72 interest. Few places in any country as noted as Oxford is, but what has
69 some distinguished person residing within its precincts. And knowing
71 that the City of Palaces was not an exception to this rule, I resolved
71 to see some of its lions. Here, of course, is the head quarters of the
72 Bishop of Oxford, a son of the late William Wilberforce, Africa's noble
73 champion. I should have been glad to have seen this distinguished pillar
73 of the Church, but I soon learned that the Bishop's residence was out of
69 town, and that he seldom visited the city except on business. I then
73 determined to see one who, although a lesser dignitary in the church, is
70 nevertheless, scarcely less known than the Bishop of Oxford. This was
72 the Rev. Dr. Pusey, a divine, whose name is known wherever the religion
63 of Jesus is known and taught, and the acknowledged head of the
68 Puseyites. On the second morning of my visit, I proceeded to Christ
73 Church Chapel, where the rev. gentleman officiates. Fortunately I had an
71 opportunity of seeing the Dr., and following close in his footsteps to
71 the church. His personal appearance is anything but that of one who is
71 the leader of a growing and powerful party in the church. He is rather
70 under the middle size, and is round shouldered, or rather stoops. His
72 profile is more striking than his front face, the nose being very large
70 and prominent. As a matter of course, I expected to see a large nose,
70 for all great men have them. He has a thoughtful, and somewhat sullen
72 brow, a firm and somewhat pensive mouth, a cheek pale, thin, and deeply
67 furrowed. A monk fresh from the cloisters of Tintern Abbey, in its
66 proudest days, could scarcely have made a more ascetic and solemn
69 appearance than did Dr. Pusey on this occasion. He is not apparently
70 above forty-five, or at most fifty years of age, and his whole aspect
67 renders him an admirable study for an artist. Dr. Pusey's style of
66 preaching is cold and tame, and one looking at him would scarcely
70 believe that such an apparently uninteresting man could cause such an
69 eruption in the Church as he has. I was glad to find that a coloured
44 young man was among the students at Oxford.
1 
73 A few months since, I paid a visit to our countryman, Alexander Crummel,
69 who is still pursuing his studies at Cambridge--a place, though much
72 inferior to Oxford as far as appearance is concerned, is yet said to be
71 greatly its superior as a place of learning. In an hour's walk through
73 the Strand, Regent, or Piccadilly Streets in London, one may meet half a
73 dozen coloured young men, who are inmates of the various Colleges in the
72 metropolis. These are all signs of progress in the cause of the sons of
73 Africa. Then let our people take courage, and with that courage let them
72 apply themselves to learning. A determination to excel is the sure road
72 to greatness, and that is as open to the black man as the white. It was
70 that which has accomplished the mightiest and noblest triumphs in the
71 intellectual and physical world. It was that which has made such rapid
69 strides towards civilization, and broken the chains of ignorance and
70 superstition, which have so long fettered the human intellect. It was
70 determination which raised so many worthy individuals from the humble
68 walks of society, and from poverty, and placed them in positions of
70 trust and renown. It is no slight barrier that can effectually oppose
65 the determination of the will--success must ultimately crown its
72 efforts. "The world shall hear of me," was the exclamation of one whose
66 name has become as familiar as household words. A Toussaint, once
71 laboured in the sugar field with his spelling-book in his pocket, amid
71 the combined efforts of a nation to keep him in ignorance. His name is
70 now recorded among the list of statesmen of the past. A Soulouque was
71 once a slave, and knew not how to read. He now sits upon the throne of
11 an Empire.
1 
69 In our own country, there are men who once held the plough, and that
68 too without any compensation, who are now presiding at the editor's
71 table. It was determination that brought out the genius of a Franklin,
73 and a Fulton, and that has distinguished many of the American Statesmen,
71 who but for their energy and determination would never have had a name
41 beyond the precincts of their own homes.
1 
69 It is not always those who have the best advantages, or the greatest
72 talents, that eventually succeed in their undertakings; but it is those
71 who strive with untiring diligence to remove all obstacles to success,
72 and who, with unconquerable resolution, labour on until the rich reward
68 of perseverance is within their grasp. Then again let me say to our
72 young men--Take courage; "There is a good time coming." The darkness of
56 the night appears greatest just before the dawn of day.

30 _Fugitive Slaves in England._
1 
1 
73 The love of freedom is one of those natural impulses of the human breast
69 which cannot be extinguished. Even the brute animals of the creation
67 feel and show sorrow and affection when deprived of their liberty.
71 Therefore is a distinguished writer justified in saying, "Man is free,
73 even were he born in chains." The Americans boast, and justly, too, that
58 Washington was the hero and model patriot of the American
71 Revolution--the man whose fame, unequalled in his own day and country,
71 will descend to the end of time, the pride and honour of humanity. The
72 American speaks with pride of the battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill;
71 and when standing in Faneuil Hall, he points to the portraits of Otis,
71 Adams, Hancock, Quincy, Warren, and Franklin, and tells you that their
67 names will go down to posterity among the world's most devoted and
36 patriotic friends of human liberty.
1 
69 It was on the first of August, 1851, that a number of men, fugitives
72 from that boasted land of freedom, assembled at the Hall of Commerce in
70 the City of London, for the purpose of laying their wrongs before the
67 British nation, and at the same time, to give thanks to the God of
73 Freedom for the liberation of their West India brethren, on the first of
72 August, 1834. Little notice had been given of the intended meeting, yet
73 it seemed to be known in all parts of the city. At the hour of half-past
73 seven, for which the meeting had been called, the spacious hall was well
70 filled, and the fugitives, followed by some of the most noted English
71 Abolitionists, entered the hall, amid the most deafening applause, and
70 took their seats on the platform. The appearance of the great hall at
72 this juncture was most splendid. Besides the committee of fugitives, on
71 the platform there were a number of the oldest and most devoted of the
73 Slave's friends. On the left of the chair sat Geo. Thompson, Esq., M.P.;
71 near him was the Rev. Jabez Burns, D.D.; and by his side the Rev. John
70 Stevenson, M.A., Wm. Farmer, Esq., R. Smith, Esq.; while on the other
69 side were the Rev. Edward Mathews, John Cunliff, Esq., Andrew Paton,
70 Esq., J.P. Edwards, Esq., and a number of coloured gentlemen from the
68 West Indies. The body of the hall was not without its distinguished
66 guests. The Chapmans and Westons of Boston, U.S., were there. The
73 Estlins and Tribes had come all the way from Bristol to attend the great
72 meeting. The Patons of Glasgow had delayed their departure, so as to be
70 present. The Massies had come in from Upper Clapton. Not far from the
71 platform sat Sir Francis Knowles, Bart., still farther back was Samuel
72 Bowly, Esq., while near the door were to be seen the greatest critic of
69 the age, and England's best living poet. Macaulay had laid aside the
73 pen, entered the hall, and was standing near the central door, while not
67 far from the historian stood the newly-appointed Poet Laureat. The
73 author of "In Memoriam" had been swept in by the crowd, and was standing
73 with his arms folded, and beholding for the first time (and probably the
72 last) so large a number of coloured men in one room. In different parts
69 of the hall were men and women from nearly all parts of the kingdom,
72 besides a large number who, drawn to London by the Exhibition, had come
65 in to see and hear these oppressed people plead their own cause.
1 
66 The writer of this sketch was chosen Chairman of the meeting, and
72 commenced its proceedings by delivering the following address, which we
52 cut from the columns of the _Morning Advertiser_:--
1 
1 
71 "The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, remarked that, although the
63 metropolis had of late been inundated with meetings of various
73 character, having reference to almost every variety of subject, yet that
72 the subject they were called upon that evening to discuss differed from
69 them all. Many of those by whom he was surrounded, like himself, had
64 been victims to the inhuman institution of Slavery, and were in
69 consequence exiled from the land of their birth. They were fugitives
73 from their native land, but not fugitives from justice, and they had not
69 fled from a monarchical, but from a so-called republican government.
70 They came from amongst a people who declared, as part of their creed,
72 that all men were born free, but who, while they did so, made slaves of
71 every sixth man, woman, and child in the country (hear, hear). He must
70 not, however, forget that one of the purposes for which they were met
69 that night was to commemorate the emancipation of their brothers and
73 sisters in the isles of the sea. That act of the British Parliament, and
73 he might add in this case with peculiar emphasis, of the British nation,
72 passed on the 12th day of August, 1833, to take effect on the first day
72 of August, 1834, and which enfranchised 800,000 West Indian slaves, was
64 an event sublime in its nature, comprehensive and mighty in its
73 immediate influences and remote consequences, precious beyond expression
67 to the cause of freedom, and encouraging beyond the measure of any
72 government on earth to the hearts of all enlightened and just men. This
73 act was the commencement of a long course of philanthropic and Christian
64 efforts on the part of some of the best men that the world ever
64 produced. It was not his intention to go into a discussion or a
73 calculation of the rise and fall of property, or whether sugar was worth
70 more or less by the act of emancipation. But the abolition of Slavery
70 in the West Indies, was a blow struck in the right direction, at that
73 most inhuman of all traffics, the slave trade--a trade which would never
69 cease so long as slavery existed, for where there was a market there
70 would be merchandise; where there was demand there would be a supply;
69 where there were carcases there would be vultures; and they might as
73 well attempt to turn the water, and make it run up the Niagara river, as
72 to change this law. It was often said by the Americans that England was
63 responsible for the existence of slavery there, because it was
71 introduced into that country while the colonies were under the British
72 Crown. If that were the case, they must come to the conclusion that, as
70 England abolished Slavery in the West Indies, she would have done the
71 same for the American States if she had had the power to do it; and if
69 that was so, they might safely say that the separation of the United
73 States from the mother country was (to say the least) a great misfortune
69 to one-sixth of the population of that land. England had set a noble
71 example to America, and he would to heaven his countrymen would follow
73 the example. The Americans boasted of their superior knowledge, but they
69 needed not to boast of their superior guilt, for that was set upon a
69 hill top, and that too, so high, that it required not the lantern of
69 Diogenes to find it out. Every breeze from the western world brought
73 upon its wings the groans and cries of the victims of this guilt. Nearly
73 all countries had fixed the seal of disapprobation on slavery, and when,
71 at some future age, this stain on the page of history shall be pointed
72 at, posterity will blush at the discrepancy between American profession
70 and American practice. What was to be thought of a people boasting of
65 their liberty, their humanity, their Christianity, their love of
73 justice, and at the same time keeping in slavery nearly four millions of
71 God's children, and shutting out from them the light of the Gospel, by
73 denying the Bible to the slave! (Hear, hear.) No education, no marriage,
71 everything done to keep the mind of the slave in darkness. There was a
64 wish on the part of the people of the northern States to shield
71 themselves from the charge of slave-holding, but as they shared in the
73 guilt, he was not satisfied with letting them off without their share in
70 the odium. And now a word about the Fugitive Slave Bill. That measure
73 was in every respect an unconstitutional measure. It set aside the right
73 formerly enjoyed by the fugitive of trial by jury--it afforded to him no
67 protection, no opportunity of proving his right to be free, and it
67 placed every free coloured person at the mercy of any unprincipled
67 individual who might wish to lay claim to him. (Hear.) That law is
72 opposed to the principles of Christianity--foreign alike to the laws of
70 God and man, it had converted the whole population of the free States
69 into a band of slave-catchers, and every rood of territory is but so
73 much hunting ground, over which they might chase the fugitive. But while
71 they were speaking of slavery in the United States, they must not omit
66 to mention that there was a strong feeling in that land, not only
66 against the Fugitive Slave Law, but also against the existence of
71 slavery in any form. There was a band of fearless men and women in the
72 city of Boston, whose labours for the slave had resulted in good beyond
73 calculation. This noble and heroic class had created an agitation in the
70 whole country, until their principles have taken root in almost every
70 association in the land, and which, with God's blessing, will, in due
70 time, cause the Americans to put into practice what they have so long
71 professed. (Hear, hear.) He wished it to be continually held up before
70 the country, that the northern States are as deeply implicated in the
72 guilt of slavery as the South. The north had a population of 13,553,328
73 freemen; the south had a population of only 6,393,756 freemen; the north
73 has 152 representatives in the house, the south only 81; and it would be
66 seen by this, that the balance of power was with the free States.
73 Looking, therefore, at the question in all its aspects, he was sure that
66 there was no one in this country but who would find out, that the
72 slavery of the United States of America was a system the most abandoned
40 and the most tyrannical. (Hear, hear.)"
1 
66 At the close of this address, the Rev. Edward Matthews, last from
72 Bristol, but who had recently returned from the United States, where he
72 had been maltreated on account of his fidelity to the cause of freedom,
73 was introduced, and made a most interesting speech. The next speaker was
70 George Thompson, Esq., M.P.; and we need only say that his eloquence,
71 which has seldom or ever been equalled, and never surpassed, exceeded,
73 on this occasion, the most sanguine expectations of his friends. All who
68 sat under the thundering anathemas which he hurled against slavery,
71 seemed instructed, delighted, and animated. No one could scarcely have
68 remained unmoved by the pensive sympathies that pervaded the entire
71 assembly. There were many in the meeting who had never seen a fugitive
71 slave before, and when any of the speakers would refer to those on the
70 platform, the whole audience seemed moved to tears. No meeting of the
68 kind held in London for years created a greater sensation than this
70 gathering of refugees from the "Land of the free, and the home of the
72 brave." The following appeal, which I had written for the occasion, was
68 unanimously adopted at the close of the meeting, and thus ended the
42 great Anti-Slavery demonstration of 1851.
1 
1 
56 AN APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND THE WORLD.
1 
68 We consider it just, both to the people of the United States and to
70 ourselves, in making an appeal to the inhabitants of other countries,
73 against the laws which have exiled us from our native land, to state the
71 ground upon which we make our appeal, and the causes which impel us to
71 do so. There are in the United States of America, at the present time,
71 between three and four millions of persons, who are held in a state of
72 slavery which has no parallel in any other part of the world; and whose
66 numbers have, within the last fifty years, increased to a fearful
70 extent. These people are not only deprived of the rights to which the
66 laws of Nature and Nature's God entitle them, but every avenue to
71 knowledge is closed against them. The laws do not recognise the family
70 relation of a slave, and extend to him protection in the enjoyment of
66 domestic endearments. Brothers and sisters, parents and children,
70 husbands and wives, are torn asunder, and permitted to see each other
71 no more. The shrieks and agonies of the slave are heard in the markets
72 at the seat of government, and within hearing of the American Congress,
71 as well as on the cotton, sugar and rice plantations of the far South.
1 
67 The history of the negroes in America is but a history of repeated
73 injuries and acts of oppression committed upon them by the whites. It is
71 not for ourselves that we make this appeal, but for those whom we have
13 left behind.
1 
70 In their Declaration of Independence, the Americans declare that "all
67 men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
72 certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the
69 pursuit of happiness." Yet one-sixth of the inhabitants of the great
73 Republic are slaves. Thus they give the lie to their own professions. No
66 one forfeits his or her character or standing in society by being
72 engaged in holding, buying or selling a slave; the details of which, in
40 all their horror, can scarcely be told.
1 
72 Although the holding of slaves is confined to fifteen of the thirty-one
73 States, yet we hold that the non-slave-holding States are equally guilty
73 with the slave-holding. If any proof is needed on this point, it will be
71 found in the passage of the inhuman Fugitive Slave Law, by Congress; a
71 law which could never have been enacted without the votes of a portion
68 of the representatives from the free States, and which is now being
70 enforced, in many of the States, with the utmost alacrity. It was the
68 passing of this law that exiled us from our native land, and it has
71 driven thousands of our brothers and sisters from the free States, and
68 compelled them to seek a refuge in the British possessions in North
72 America. The Fugitive Slave Law has converted the entire country, North
71 and South, into one vast hunting-ground. We would respectfully ask you
69 to expostulate with the Americans, and let them know that you regard
73 their treatment of the coloured people of that country as a violation of
71 every principle of human brotherhood, of natural right, of justice, of
59 humanity, of Christianity, of love to God and love to man.
1 
69 It is needless that we should remind you that the religious sects of
64 America, with but few exceptions, are connected with the sin of
73 slavery--the churches North as well as South. We would have you tell the
70 professed Christians of that land, that if they would be respected by
73 you, they must separate themselves from the unholy alliance with men who
70 are daily committing deeds which, if done in England, would cause the
68 perpetrator to be sent to a felon's doom; that they must refuse the
60 right hand of Christian fellowship, whether individually or
72 collectively, to those implicated, in any way, in the guilt of slavery.
1 
70 We do not ask for a forcible interference on your part, but only that
67 you will use all lawful and peaceful means to restore to this much
71 injured race their God-given rights. The moral and religious sentiment
71 of mankind must be arrayed against slave-holding, to make it infamous,
70 ere we can hope to see it abolished. We would ask you to set them the
71 example, by excluding from your pulpits, and from religious communion,
73 the slave-holding and pro-slavery ministers who may happen to visit this
66 country. We would even go further, and ask you to shut your doors
71 against either ministers or laymen, who are at all guilty of upholding
71 and sustaining this monster sin. By the cries of the slave, which come
71 from the fields and swamps of the far South, we ask you to do this! By
70 that spirit of liberty and equality of which you all admire, we would
72 ask you to do this. And by that still nobler, higher, and holier spirit
71 of our beloved Saviour, we would ask you to stamp upon the head of the
73 slaveholder, with a brand deeper than that which marks the victim of his
73 wrongs, the infamy of theft, adultery, man-stealing, piracy, and murder,
70 and, by the force of public opinion, compel him to "unloose the heavy
40 burden, and let the oppressed go free."

12 LETTER XXI.
1 
33 _A Chapter on American Slavery._
1 
1 
70 The word Englishman is but another name for an American, and the word
71 American is but another name for an Englishman--England is the father,
69 America the son. They have a common origin and identity of language;
73 they hold the same religious and political opinions; they study the same
72 histories, and have the same literature. Steam and mechanical ingenuity
71 have brought the two countries within nine days sailing of each other.
72 The Englishman on landing at New-York finds his new neighbours speaking
72 the same language which he last heard on leaving Liverpool, and he sees
72 the American in the same dress that he had been accustomed to look upon
67 at home, and soon forgets that he is three thousand miles from his
64 native land, and in another country. The American on landing at
72 Liverpool, and taking a walk through the great commercial city, finding
69 no difficulty in understanding the people, supposes himself still in
71 New-York; and if there seems any doubt in his own mind, growing out of
73 the fact that the people have a more healthy look, seem more polite, and
72 that the buildings have a more substantial appearance than those he had
69 formerly looked upon, he has only to imagine, as did Rip Van Winkle,
45 that he has been asleep these hundred years.
1 
67 If the Englishman who has seen a Thompson silenced in Boston, or a
72 Macready mobbed in New-York, upon the ground that they were foreigners,
67 should sit in Exeter Hall and hear an American orator until he was
70 hoarse, and wonder why the American is better treated in England than
70 the Englishman in America, he has only to attribute it to John Bull's
73 superior knowledge of good manners, and his being a more law-abiding man
72 than brother Jonathan. England and America has each its reforms and its
71 reformers, and they have more or less sympathy with each other. It has
70 been said that one generation commences a reform in England, and that
72 another generation finishes it. I would that so much could be said with
72 regard to the great object of reform in America--the system of slavery!
1 
72 No evil was ever more deeply rooted in a country than is slavery in the
70 United States. Spread over the largest and most fertile States in the
71 Union, with decidedly the best climate, and interwoven, as it is, with
69 the religious, political, commercial, and social institutions of the
72 country, it is scarcely possible to estimate its influence. This is the
70 evil which claims the attention of American Reformers, over and above
67 every other evil in the land, and thanks to a kind providence, the
71 American slave is not without his advocates. The greatest enemy to the
71 Anti-Slavery Society, and the most inveterate opposer of the men whose
67 names stand at the head of the list as officers and agents of that
73 association, will, we think, assign to William Lloyd Garrison, the first
72 place in the ranks of the American Abolitionists. The first to proclaim
72 the doctrine of immediate emancipation to the slaves of America, and on
70 that account an object of hatred to the slave-holding interest of the
68 country, and living for years with his life in danger, he is justly
71 regarded by all, as the leader of the Anti-Slavery movement in the New
64 World. Mr. Garrison is at the present time but little more than
67 forty-five years of age, and of the middle size. He has a high and
73 prominent forehead, well developed, with no hair on the top of the head,
67 having lost it in early life; with a piercing eye, a pleasant, yet
69 anxious countenance, and of a most loveable disposition; tender, and
71 blameless in his family affections, devoted to his friends; simple and
66 studious, upright, guileless, distinguished, and worthy, like the
72 distinguished men of antiquity, to be immortalized by another Plutarch.
68 How many services never to be forgotten, has he not rendered to the
68 cause of the slave, and the welfare of mankind! As a speaker, he is
73 forcible, clear, and logical, yet he will not rank with the many who are
68 less known. As a writer, he is regarded as one of the finest in the
68 United States, and certainly the most prominent in the Anti-Slavery
68 cause. Had Mr. Garrison wished to serve himself, he might, with his
72 great talents, long since, have been at the head of either of the great
72 political parties. Few men can withstand the allurements of office, and
71 the prize-money that accompanies them. Many of those who were with him
68 fifteen years ago, have been swept down with the current of popular
70 favour, either in Church or State. He has seen a Cox on the one hand,
66 and a Stanton on the other, swept away like so much floating wood
73 before the tide. When the sturdiest characters gave way, when the finest
70 geniuses passed one after another under the yoke of slavery, Garrison
73 stood firm to his convictions, like a rock that stands stirless amid the
66 conflicting agitation of the waves. He is not only the friend and
73 advocate of freedom with his pen and his tongue, but to the oppressed of
72 every clime he opens his purse, his house, and his heart: yet he is not
73 a man of money. The fugitive slave, fresh from the whips and chains, who
70 is turned off by the politician, and experiences the cold shoulder of
73 the divine, finds a bed and a breakfast under the hospitable roof of Mr.
16 Lloyd Garrison.
1 
61 The party of which he is the acknowledged head, is one of no
70 inconsiderable influence in the United States. No man has more bitter
72 enemies or stauncher friends than he. There are those among his friends
70 who would stake their all upon his veracity and integrity; and we are
68 sure that the coloured people throughout America, bond and free, in
71 whose cause he has so long laboured, will, with one accord, assign the
62 highest niche in their affection to the champion of universal
73 emancipation. Every cause has its writers and its orators. We have drawn
72 a hasty and imperfect sketch of the greatest writer in the Anti-Slavery
68 field: we shall now call attention to the most distinguished public
73 speaker. The name of Wendell Phillips is but another name for eloquence.
71 Born in the highest possible position in America, Mr. Phillips has all
71 the advantages that birth can give to one in that country. Educated at
72 the first University, graduating with all the honours which the College
71 could bestow on him, and studying the law and becoming a member of the
72 bar, he has all the accomplishments that these advantages can give to a
72 man of a great mind. Nature has treated him as a favourite. His stature
65 is not tall, but handsome; his expressive countenance paints and
65 reflects every emotion of his soul. His gestures are wonderfully
72 graceful, like his delivery. There is a fascination in the soft gaze of
71 his eyes, which none can but admire. Being a great reader, and endowed
64 by nature with a good memory, he supplies himself with the most
71 complicated dates and historical events. Nothing can equal the variety
72 of his matter. I have heard him more than twenty different times on the
73 same subject, but never heard the same speech. He is personal, but there
70 is nothing offensive in his personalities. He extracts from a subject
72 all that it contains, and does it as none but Wendell Phillips can. His
71 voice is beautifully musical, and it is calculated to attract wherever
70 it is heard. He is a man of calm intrepidity, of a patriotic and warm
64 heart, with manners the most affable, temper the most gentle, a
72 rectitude of principle entirely natural, a freedom from ambition, and a
70 modesty quite singular. As Napoleon kept the Old Guard in reserve, to
70 turn the tide in battle, so do the Abolitionists keep Mr. Phillips in
71 reserve when opposition is expected in their great gatherings. We have
72 seen the meetings turned into a bedlam, by the mobocratic slave-holding
70 spirit, and when the speakers had one after another left the platform
64 without a hearing, and the chairman had lost all control of the
72 assembly, the appearance of this gentleman upon the platform would turn
63 the tide of events. He would not beg for a hearing, but on the
70 contrary, he would lash them as no preceding speaker had done. If, by
71 their groans and yells, they stifled his voice, he would stand unmoved
73 with his arms folded, and by the very eloquence of his looks put them to
72 silence. His speeches against the Fugitive Slave Law, and his withering
68 rebukes of Daniel Webster and other northern men who supported that
71 measure, are of the most splendid character, and will compare in point
68 of composition with anything ever uttered by Chatham or Sheridan in
67 their palmiest days. As a public speaker, Mr. Phillips is, without
73 doubt, the first in the United States. Considering his great talent, his
73 high birth, and the prospects which lay before him, and the fact that he
72 threw everything aside to plead the slave's cause, we must be convinced
72 that no man has sacrificed more upon the altar of humanity than Wendell
10 Phillips.
1 
65 Within the past ten years, a great impetus has been given to the
71 anti-slavery movement in America by coloured men who have escaped from
70 slavery. Coming as they did from the very house of bondage, and being
67 able to speak from sad experience, they could speak as none others
7 could.
1 
72 The gentleman to whom we shall now call attention is one of this class,
70 and doubtless the first of his race in America. The name of Frederick
72 Douglass is well known throughout this country as well as America. Born
69 and brought up as a slave, he was deprived of a mother's care and of
71 early education. Escaping when he was little more than twenty years of
68 age, he was thrown upon his own resources in the free states, where
73 prejudice against colour is but another name for slavery. But during all
73 this time he was educating himself as well as circumstances would admit.
69 Mr. Douglass commenced his career as a public speaker some ten years
65 since, as an agent of the American or Massachusetts Anti-Slavery
65 Societies. He is tall and well made. His vast and well-developed
69 forehead announces the power of his intellect. His voice is full and
70 sonorous. His attitude is dignified, and his gesticulation is full of
68 noble simplicity. He is a man of lofty reason, natural, and without
71 pretension, always master of himself, brilliant in the art of exposing
73 and of abstracting. Few persons can handle a subject with which they are
72 familiar better than Mr. Douglass. There is a kind of eloquence issuing
72 from the depth of the soul, as from a spring, rolling along its copious
64 floods, sweeping all before it, overwhelming by its very force,
71 carrying, upsetting, engulphing its adversaries, and more dazzling and
73 more thundering than the bolt which leaps from crag to crag. This is the
73 eloquence of Frederick Douglass. He is one of the greatest mimics of the
70 age. No man can put on a sweeter smile or a more sarcastic frown than
71 he: you cannot put him off his guard. He is always in good humour. Mr.
71 Douglass possesses great dramatic powers; and had he taken up the sock
73 and buskin, instead of becoming a lecturer, he would have made as fine a
35 Coriolanus as ever trod the stage.
1 
67 However, Mr. Douglass was not the first coloured man that became a
70 lecturer, and thereby did service to the cause of his countrymen. The
68 earliest and most effective speaker from among the coloured race in
64 America, was Charles Lennox Remond. In point of eloquence, this
66 gentleman is not inferior to either Wendell Phillips or Frederick
71 Douglass. Mr. Remond is of small stature, and neat figure, with a head
71 well developed, but a remarkably thin face. As an elocutionist, he is,
69 without doubt, the first on the anti-slavery platform. He has a good
73 voice, a pleasing countenance, a prompt intelligence, and when speaking,
72 is calculated to captivate and carry away an audience by the very force
69 of his eloquence. Born in the freest state of the Union, and of most
69 respectable parents, he prides himself not a little on his birth and
67 descent. One can scarcely find fault with this, for, in the United
71 States, the coloured man is deprived of the advantages which parentage
67 gives to the white man. Mr. Remond is a descendant of one of those
68 coloured men who stood side by side with white men on the plains of
72 Concord and Lexington, in the battles that achieved the independence of
72 the colonies from the mother country, in the war of the Revolution. Mr.
72 Remond has felt deeply, (probably more so than any other coloured man),
72 the odious prejudice against colour. On this point he is sensitive to a
70 fault. If any one will sit for an hour and hear a lecture from him on
73 this subject, if he is not converted, he will at least become convinced,
70 that the boiling cauldron of anti-slavery discussion has never thrown
65 upon its surface a more fiery spirit than Charles Lennox Remond.
1 
70 There are some men who neither speak nor write, but whose lives place
73 them in the foremost ranks in the cause which they espouse. One of these
71 is Francis Jackson. He was one of the earliest to give countenance and
70 support to the anti-slavery movement. In the year 1835, when a mob of
73 more than 5000 merchants and others, in Boston, broke up an anti-slavery
72 meeting of females, at which William Lloyd Garrison and George Thompson
72 were to deliver addresses, and when the Society had no room in which to
71 hold its meetings (having been driven from their own room by the mob),
67 Francis Jackson, with a moral courage scarcely ever equalled, came
70 forward and offered his private dwelling to the ladies, to hold their
70 meeting in. The following interesting passage occurs in a letter from
71 him to the Secretary of the Society a short time after, on receiving a
35 vote of thanks from its members:--
1 
72 "If a large majority of this community choose to turn a deaf ear to the
70 wrongs which are inflicted upon their countrymen in other portions of
73 the land--if they are content to turn away from the sight of oppression,
48 and 'pass by on the other side'--so it must be.
1 
67 "But when they undertake in any way to impair or annul my right to
69 speak, write, and publish upon any subject, and more especially upon
71 enormities, which are the common concern of every lover of his country
70 and his kind--so it must not be--so it shall not be, if I for one can
69 prevent it. Upon this great right let us hold on at all hazards. And
67 should we, in its exercise, be driven from public halls to private
72 dwellings, one house at least shall be consecrated to its preservation.
72 And if, in defence of this sacred privilege, which man did not give me,
73 and shall not (if I can help it) take from me, this roof and these walls
72 shall be levelled to the earth, let them fall if they must; they cannot
71 crumble in a better cause. They will appear of very little value to me
55 after their owner shall have been whipt into silence."
1 
70 There are among the contributors to the Anti-Slavery cause, a few who
71 give with a liberality which has never been surpassed by the donors to
71 any benevolent association in the world, according to their means--the
35 chief of these is Francis Jackson.
1 
72 In the month of May, 1844, while one evening strolling up Broadway, New
71 York, I saw a crowd making its way into the Minerva Rooms, and, having
69 no pressing engagement, I followed, and was soon in a splendid hall,
72 where some twelve or fifteen hundred persons were seated, and listening
69 to rather a strange-looking man. The speaker was tall and slim, with
72 long arms, long legs, and a profusion of auburn or reddish hair hanging
70 in ringlets down his shoulders; while a huge beard of the same colour
71 fell upon his breast. His person was not at all improved by his dress.
70 The legs of his trousers were shorter than those worn by smaller men:
70 the sleeves of his coat were small and short, the shirt collar turned
70 down in Byronic style, beard and hair hid his countenance, so that no
68 redeeming feature could be found there; yet there was one redeeming
69 quality about the man--that was the stream of fervid eloquence which
73 escaped from his lips. I inquired his name, and was informed that it was
73 Charles C. Burleigh. Nature has been profuse in showering her gifts upon
71 Mr. Burleigh, but all has been bestowed upon his head and heart. There
70 is a kind of eloquence which weaves its thread around the hearer, and
65 gradually draws him into its web, fascinating him with its gaze,
73 entangling him as the spider does the fly, until he is fast: such is the
72 eloquence of C.C. Burleigh. As a debater he is unquestionably the first
68 on the Anti-slavery platform. If he did not speak so fast, he would
64 equal Wendell Phillips; if he did not reason his subject out of
72 existence, he would surpass him. However, one would have to travel over
72 many miles, and look in the faces of many men, before he would find one
71 who has made more personal sacrifices, or done more to bring about the
67 Emancipation of the American Slaves, than Mr. Charles C. Burleigh.
1 
69 Whoever the future historian of the Anti-Slavery movement may be, he
70 will not be able to compile a correct history of this great struggle,
69 without consulting the writings of Edmund Quincy, a member of one of
73 the wealthiest, patriotic, and aristocratic families in New England: the
69 prestige of his name is a passport to all that the heart could wish.
67 Descended from a family, whose name is connected with all that was
72 glorious in the great American Revolution, the son of one who has again
69 and again represented his native State, in the National Congress, he
62 too, like Wendell Phillips, threw away the pearl of political
70 preferment, and devoted his distinguished talents to the cause of the
71 Slave. Mr. Quincy is better known in this country as having filled the
69 editorial chair of _The Liberator_, during the several visits of its
72 Editor to Great Britain. As a speaker, he does not rank as high as some
73 who are less known; as a writer, he has few equals. The "Annual Reports"
70 of the American and Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Societies for the past
72 fifteen or twenty years, have emanated from his pen. When posterity, in
68 digging among the tombs of the friends of mankind, and of universal
72 freedom, shall fail to find there the name of Edmund Quincy, it will be
44 because the engraver failed to do his duty.
1 
62 Were we sent out to find a man who should excel all others in
72 collecting together new facts and anecdotes, and varnishing up old ones
68 so that they would appear new, and bringing them into a meeting and
66 emptying out, good or bad, the whole contents of his sack, to the
71 delight and admiration of the audience, we would unhesitatingly select
73 James N. Buffum as the man. If Mr. Buffum is not a great speaker, he has
70 what many accomplished orators have not--_i.e._, a noble and generous
71 heart. If the fugitive slave, fresh from the cotton-field, should make
72 his appearance in the town of Lynn, in Massachusetts, and should need a
64 night's lodging or refreshments, he need go no farther than the
36 hospitable door of James N. Buffum.
1 
69 Most men who inherit large fortunes, do little or nothing to benefit
72 mankind. A few, however, spend their means in the best possible manner:
68 one of the latter class is Gerrit Smith. The name of this gentleman
72 should have been brought forward among those who are first mentioned in
70 this chapter. Some eight or ten years ago, Mr. Smith was the owner of
72 large tracts of land, lying in twenty-nine counties in the State of New
70 York, and came to the strange conclusion to give the most of it away.
73 Consequently, three thousand lots of land, containing from thirty to one
63 hundred acres each, were given to coloured men residing in the
51 State--the writer of this being one of the number.
1 
73 Although universal suffrage is enjoyed by the whites in the State of New
72 York, a property-qualification is imposed on coloured men; and this act
72 of Mr. Smith's not only made three thousand men the owners of land, but
65 created also three thousand voters. The ability to give, and the
71 willingness to do so, is not by any means the greatest quality of this
72 gentleman. As a public speaker, Mr. Smith has few equals; and certainly
64 no man in his State has done more to forward the cause of Negro
22 Emancipation than he.
1 
65 We have already swelled the pages of this chapter beyond what we
73 intended when we commenced, but yet we have called attention to only one
70 branch of American Reformers. The Temperance Reformers are next to be
69 considered. This cause has many champions, and yet none who occupy a
73 very prominent position before the world. The first temperance newspaper
70 published in the United States, was edited by William Lloyd Garrison.
70 Gerrit Smith has also done much in promulgating temperance views. But
73 the most noted man in the movement at the present time, and the one best
73 known to the British public, is John B. Gough. This gentleman was at one
72 time an actor on the stage, and subsequently became an inebriate of the
65 most degraded kind. He was, however, reclaimed through the great
69 Washingtonian movement that swept over the United States a few years
73 since. In stature, Mr. Gough is tall and slim, with black hair, which he
71 usually wears too long. As an orator, he is considered among the first
67 in the United States. Having once been an actor, he throws all his
73 dramatic powers into his addresses. He has a facility of telling strange
71 and marvellous stories which can scarcely be surpassed; and what makes
68 them still more interesting, he always happens to be an eyewitness.
73 While speaking, he acts the drunkard, and does it in a style which could
67 not be equalled on the boards of the Lyceum or Adelphi. No man has
73 obtained more signatures to the temperance pledge than he. After all, it
72 is a question whether he has ever been of any permanent service to this
72 reform or not. Mr. Gough has more than once fallen from his position as
73 a teetotaler; more than once he has broken his pledge, and when found by
70 his friends, was in houses of a questionable character. However, some
71 are of opinion that these defects have been of use to him; for when he
68 has made his appearance after one of these debaucheries, the people
73 appear to sympathize more with him, and some thought he spoke better. If
69 we believe that a person could enjoy good health with water upon the
67 brain, we would be of opinion that Mr. Gough's cranium contained a
73 greater quantity than that of any other living man. When speaking before
70 an audience, he can weep when he pleases; and the tears shed on these
71 occasions are none of your make-believe kind--none of your small drops
65 trickling down the cheeks one at a time;--but they come in great
69 showers, so as even to sprinkle upon the paper which he holds in his
68 hand. Of course, he is not alone in shedding tears in his meetings,
70 many of his hearers usually join him; especially the ladies, as these
71 showers are intended for them. However, no one can sit for an hour and
73 hear John. B. Gough, without coming to the conclusion that he is nothing
35 more than a theatrical mountebank.
1 
72 The ablest speaker on the subject of Peace, is Charles Sumner. Standing
72 more than six feet in height, and well proportioned, Mr. Sumner makes a
70 most splendid and commanding appearance before an assembly. It is not
73 his looks alone that attract attention--his very countenance indicates a
71 superior mind. Born in the upper circle, educated in the first College
69 in the country, and finally becoming a member of the Bar, he is well
72 qualified to take the highest possible position as a public speaker. As
73 an orator, Charles Sumner has but one superior in the United States, and
65 that is Wendell Phillips. Mr. Sumner is an able advocate for the
72 liberation of the American Slaves as well as of the cause of Peace, and
50 has rendered great aid to the abolition movement.
1 
69 The name of Elihu Burritt, for many reasons, should be placed at the
69 head of the Peace Movement. No man was ever more devoted to one idea
71 than he is to that of peace. If he is an advocate of Temperance, it is
69 because it will promote peace. If he opposes Slavery, it is upon the
73 grounds of peace. Ask him why he wants an "Ocean Penny Postage," he will
73 tell you to engender the principles of peace. Everything with him hinges
68 upon the doctrine of peace. As a speaker, Mr. Burritt does not rank
73 amongst the first. However, his speeches are of a high order, some think
70 them too high, and complain that he is too much of a cloud-traveller,
72 and when he descends from these aerial flights and cloudy thrones, they
71 are unwilling to admit that he can be practical. If Mr. Burritt should
69 prove as good a statesman as a theorist, he would be an exception to
71 most who belong to the aerial school. As a writer he stands deservedly
73 high. In his "Sparks from the Anvil," and "Voice from the Forge," are to
72 be found as fine pieces as have been produced by any writer of the day.
68 His "Drunkard's Wife" is the most splendid thing of the kind in the
71 language. His stature is of the middle size, head well developed, with
71 eyes deeply set, and a prepossessing countenance, though not handsome;
71 he wears an exterior of remarkable austerity, and everything about him
73 is grave, even to his smile. Being well versed in the languages, ancient
67 and modern, he does not lack variety or imagination, either in his
71 public addresses or private conversation; yet it would be difficult to
71 find a man with a better heart, or sweeter spirit, than Elihu Burritt.

13 LETTER XXII.
1 
35 _A Narrative of American Slavery._
1 
1 
70 Although the first slaves, introduced into the American Colonies from
72 the coast of Africa, were negroes of a very dark complexion with woolly
71 hair, and it was thought that slavery would be confined to the blacks,
69 yet the present slave population of America is far from being black.
70 This change in colour, is attributable, solely to the unlimited power
71 which the slave owner exercises over his victim. There being no lawful
67 marriage amongst slaves, and no encouragement to slave women to be
66 virtuous and chaste, there seems to be no limits to the system of
72 amalgamation carried on between master and slave. This accounts for the
69 fact, that most persons who go from Europe, or from the Free States,
67 into Carolina or Virginia, are struck with the different shades of
73 colour amongst the slaves. On a plantation employing fifty slaves, it is
67 not uncommon to see one third of them mulattoes, and some of these
14 nearly white.
1 
70 In the year 1831, there resided in the state of Virginia, a slave who
68 was so white, that no one would suppose for a moment that a drop of
71 African blood coursed through his veins. His skin was fair, hair soft,
72 straight, fine and white; his eyes blue, nose prominent, lips thin; his
70 head well formed, forehead high and prominent; and he was often taken
70 for a white free person, by those who did not know him. This made his
70 condition as a slave still more intolerable; for one so white, seldom
72 ever receives fair treatment at the hands of his fellow slaves; and the
72 whites usually regard such slaves as persons, who, if not often flogged
73 and otherwise ill treated, to remind them of their condition, would soon
71 "forget" that they were slaves, and "think themselves as good as white
70 folks." During that year, an insurrection broke out amongst the slave
67 population, known as the Southampton Rebellion, or the "Nat Turner
69 Insurrection." Five or six hundred slaves, believing in the doctrine
72 that "all men are created equal," armed with such weapons as they could
70 get, commenced a war for freedom. Amongst these was George, the white
71 slave of whom we have spoken. He had been employed as a house servant,
68 and had heard his master and visiters speak of the down-trodden and
68 oppressed Poles; he heard them talk of going to Greece to fight for
70 Grecian liberty, and against the oppressors of that ill-fated people.
70 George, fired with the love of freedom, and zeal for the cause of his
65 enslaved countrymen, joined the insurrection. The result of that
72 struggle for liberty is well known. The slaves were defeated, and those
70 who were not taken prisoners, took refuge in the dismal swamps. These
68 were ordered to surrender; but instead of doing so, they challenged
72 their proud oppressors to take them, and immediately renewed the war. A
72 ferocious struggle now commenced between the parties; but not until the
68 United States troops were called in, did they succeed in crushing a
73 handful of men and women who were fighting for freedom. The negroes were
72 hunted with dogs, and many who were caught were burnt alive; while some
59 were hung, and others flogged and banished from the State.
1 
71 Among those who were sentenced to be hanged, was George. He was placed
71 in prison to await the day of execution, which would give him ten days
72 to prepare for his doom. George was the son of a member of the American
63 Congress, his mother being a servant in the principal hotel in
73 Washington, where members of Congress usually put up. After the birth of
70 George, his mother was sold to a negro trader, and he to a Virginian,
72 who sent agents through the country to buy up young slaves to raise for
65 the market. George was only about nineteen years of age, when he
69 unfortunately became connected with the insurrection. Mr. Green, who
69 owned George, was a comparatively good master, and prided himself on
70 treating his slaves better than most men. This gentleman was also the
64 owner of a girl who was perfectly white, with straight hair and
69 prominent features. This girl was said to be the daughter of her own
73 master. A feeling of attachment sprang up between Mary and George, which
67 proved to be more than mere friendship, and upon which we base the
26 burden of this narrative.
1 
73 After poor George had been sentenced to death and cast into prison, Mary
69 begged and obtained leave to visit George, and administer to him the
69 comforts of religion, as she was a member of a religious body, while
70 George was not. As George had been a considerable favourite with Mrs.
69 Green, Mary had no difficulty in obtaining permission to pay a daily
68 visit to him, to whom she had pledged her heart and hand. At one of
63 these meetings, and only four days from the time fixed for the
70 execution, while Mary was seated in George's cell, it occurred to her
69 that she might yet save him from a felon's doom. She revealed to him
67 the secret that was then occupying her thoughts, viz., that George
65 should exchange clothes with her, and thus attempt his escape in
61 disguise. But he would not for a single moment listen to the
71 proposition. Not that he feared detection; but he would not consent to
70 place an innocent and affectionate girl in a position where she might
62 have to suffer for him. Mary pleaded, but in vain--George was
72 inflexible. The poor girl left her lover with a heavy heart, regretting
41 that her scheme had proved unsuccessful.
1 
69 Towards the close of the next day, Mary again appeared at the prison
73 door for admission, and was soon by the side of him whom she so ardently
68 loved. While there, the clouds which had overhung the city for some
67 hours, broke, and the rain fell in torrents amid the most terrific
68 thunder and lightning. In the most persuasive manner possible, Mary
69 again importuned George to avail himself of her assistance to escape
69 from an ignominious death. After assuring him that she not being the
70 person condemned, would not receive any injury, he at last consented,
72 and they began to exchange apparel. As George was of small stature, and
68 both were white, there was no difficulty in his passing out without
71 detection: and as she usually left the cell weeping, with handkerchief
71 in hand, and sometimes at her face, he had only to adopt this mode and
67 his escape was safe. They had kissed each other, and Mary had told
70 George where he would find a small parcel of provisions which she had
71 placed in a secluded spot, when the prison-keeper opened the door, and
68 said, "Come, girl, it is time for you to go." George again embraced
69 Mary, and passed out of the gaol. It was already dark and the street
70 lamps were lighted, so that our hero in his new dress had no dread of
73 detection. The provisions were sought out and found, and poor George was
73 soon on the road towards Canada. But neither of them had once thought of
69 a change of dress for George when he should have escaped, and he had
72 walked but a short distance before he felt that a change of his apparel
68 would facilitate his progress. But he dared not go amongst even his
69 coloured associates for fear of being betrayed. However, he made the
71 best of his way on towards Canada, hiding in the woods during the day,
59 and travelling by the guidance of the North Star at night.
1 
70 One morning, George arrived on the banks of the Ohio river, and found
69 his journey had terminated, unless he could get some one to take him
70 across the river in a secret manner, for he would not be permitted to
67 cross in any of the ferry boats; it being a penalty for crossing a
72 slave, besides the value of the slave. He concealed himself in the tall
62 grass and weeds near the river, to see if he could embrace an
72 opportunity to cross. He had been in his hiding-place but a short time,
65 when he observed a man in a small boat, floating near the shore,
72 evidently fishing. His first impulse was to call out to the man and ask
71 him to take him over to the Ohio side, but the fear that the man was a
73 slaveholder, or one who might possibly arrest him, deterred him from it.
72 The man after rowing and floating about for some time fastened the boat
70 to the root of a tree, and started to a neighbouring farm-house. This
65 was George's moment, and he seized it. Running down the bank, he
67 unfastened the boat, jumped in, and with all the expertness of one
68 accustomed to a boat, rowed across the river and landed on the Ohio
6 side.
1 
67 Being now in a free state, he thought he might with perfect safety
73 travel on towards Canada. He had, however, gone but a few miles, when he
69 discovered two men on horseback coming behind him. He felt sure that
71 they could not be in pursuit of him, yet he did not wish to be seen by
70 them, so he turned into another road, leading to a house near by. The
72 men followed, and were but a short distance from George, when he ran up
70 to a farm house, before which was standing a farmer-looking man, in a
71 broad-brimmed hat and straight collared coat, whom he implored to save
71 him from the "slave-catchers." The farmer told him to go into the barn
73 near by; he entered by the front door, the farmer following, and closing
70 the door behind George, but remaining outside, and gave directions to
73 his hired man as to what should be done with George. The slaveholders by
70 this time had dismounted, and were in the front of the barn demanding
70 admittance, and charging the farmer with secreting their slave woman,
73 for George was still in the dress of a woman. The Friend, for the farmer
71 proved to be a member of the Society of Friends, told the slave-owners
71 that if they wished to search his barn, they must first get an officer
73 and a search warrant. While the parties were disputing, the farmer began
73 nailing up the front door, and the hired man served the back door in the
71 same way. The slaveholders, finding that they could not prevail on the
72 Friend to allow them to get the slave, determined to go in search of an
68 officer. One was left to see that the slave did not escape from the
68 barn, while the other went off at full speed to Mount Pleasant, the
72 nearest town. George was not the slave of either of these men, nor were
71 they in pursuit of him, but they had lost a woman who had been seen in
66 that vicinity, and when they saw poor George in the disguise of a
72 female, and attempting to elude pursuit, they felt sure they were close
72 upon their victim. However, if they had caught him, although he was not
72 their slave, they would have taken him back and placed him in goal, and
54 there he would have remained until his owner arrived.
1 
71 After an absence of nearly two hours, the slave owner returned with an
73 officer and found the Friend still driving large nails into the door. In
67 a triumphant tone, and with a corresponding gesture, he handed the
73 search-warrant to the Friend, and said, "There, Sir, now I will see if I
71 can't get my Nigger." "Well," said the Friend, "thou hast gone to work
67 according to law, and thou can now go into my barn." "Lend me your
72 hammer that I may get the door open," said the slaveholder. "Let me see
73 the warrant again." And after reading it over once more, he said, "I see
71 nothing in this paper which says I must supply thee with tools to open
73 my door; if thou wishes to go in, thou must get a hammer elsewhere." The
69 sheriff said, "I will go to a neighbouring farm and borrow something
67 which will introduce us to Miss Dinah;" and he immediately went in
64 search of tools. In a short time the officer returned, and they
73 commenced an assault and battery upon the barn door, which soon yielded;
70 and in went the slaveholder and officer, and began turning up the hay
67 and using all other means to find the lost property; but, to their
71 astonishment, the slave was not there. After all hope of getting Dinah
71 was gone, the slave-owner in a rage, said to the Friend, "My Nigger is
73 not here." "I did not tell thee there was any one here." "Yes, but I saw
71 her go in, and you shut the door behind her, and if she was not in the
73 barn, what did you nail the door for?" "Can't I do what I please with my
72 own barn door? Now I will tell thee; thou need trouble thyself no more,
73 for the person thou art after entered the front door and went out at the
73 back door, and is a long way from here by this time. Thou and thy friend
67 must be somewhat fatigued by this time, wont thou go in and take a
73 little dinner with me?" We need not say that this cool invitation of the
65 good Quaker was not accepted by the slaveholders. George, in the
72 meantime, had been taken to a Friend's dwelling some miles away, where,
71 after laying aside his female attire, and being snugly dressed up in a
70 straight collared coat, and pantaloons to match, was again put on the
70 right road towards Canada. Two weeks after this found him in the town
73 of St. Catharines, working on the farm of Colonel Strut, and attending a
14 night school.
1 
68 George, however, did not forget his promise to use all means in his
71 power to get Mary out of slavery. He, therefore, laboured with all his
67 might, to obtain money with which to employ some one to go back to
73 Virginia for Mary. After nearly six months' labour at St. Catharines, he
66 employed an English missionary to go and see if the girl could be
67 purchased, and at what price. The missionary went accordingly, but
68 returned with the sad intelligence that on account of Mary's aiding
71 George to escape, the court had compelled Mr. Green to sell her out of
72 the State, and she had been sold to a Negro trader and taken to the New
69 Orleans market. As all hope of getting the girl was now gone, George
70 resolved to quit the American continent for ever. He immediately took
72 passage in a vessel laden with timber, bound for Liverpool, and in five
70 weeks from that time he was standing on the quay of the great English
72 seaport. With little or no education, he found many difficulties in the
70 way of getting a respectable living. However, he obtained a situation
69 as porter in a large house in Manchester, where he worked during the
68 day, and took private lessons at night. In this way he laboured for
73 three years, and was then raised to the situation of a clerk. George was
71 so white as easily to pass for a white man, and being somewhat ashamed
71 of his African descent, he never once mentioned the fact of his having
70 been a slave. He soon became a partner in the firm that employed him,
35 and was now on the road to wealth.
1 
72 In the year 1842, just ten years after George Green (for he adopted his
69 master's name) arrived in England, he visited France, and spent some
70 days at Dunkirk. It was towards sunset, on a warm day in the month of
73 October, that Mr. Green, after strolling some distance from the Hotel de
71 Leon, entered a burial ground and wandered long alone among the silent
71 dead, gazing upon the many green graves and marble tombstones of those
71 who once moved on the theatre of busy life, and whose sounds of gaiety
72 once fell upon the ear of man. All nature around was hushed in silence,
68 and seemed to partake of the general melancholy which hung over the
66 quiet resting place of departed mortals. After tracing the varied
70 inscriptions which told the characters or conditions of the departed,
72 and viewing the mounds 'neath which the dust of mortality slumbered, he
70 had now reached a secluded spot, near to where an aged weeping willow
70 bowed its thick foliage to the ground, as though anxious to hide from
67 the scrutinizing gaze of curiosity the grave beneath it. Mr. Green
72 seated himself upon a marble tomb, and began to read Roscoe's Leo X., a
71 copy of which he had under his arm. It was then about twilight, and he
73 had scarcely gone through half a page, when he observed a lady in black,
73 leading a boy some five years old up one of the paths; and as the lady's
69 black veil was over her face, he felt somewhat at liberty to eye her
72 more closely. While looking at her, the lady gave a scream and appeared
69 to be in a fainting position, when Mr. Green sprang from his seat in
72 time to save her from falling to the ground. At this moment, an elderly
63 gentleman was seen approaching with a rapid step, who from his
72 appearance was evidently the lady's father, or one intimately connected
67 with her. He came up, and in a confused manner, asked what was the
69 matter. Mr. Green explained as well as he could. After taking up the
71 smelling bottle which had fallen from her hand, and holding it a short
70 time to her face, she soon began to revive. During all this time, the
69 lady's veil had so covered her face, that Mr. Green had not seen it.
73 When she had so far recovered as to be able to raise her head, she again
70 screamed, and fell back into the arms of the old man. It now appeared
68 quite certain, that either the countenance of George Green, or some
67 other object, was the cause of these fits of fainting; and the old
71 gentleman, thinking it was the former, in rather a petulant tone said,
72 "I will thank you, Sir, if you will leave us alone." The child whom the
66 lady was leading had now set up a squall; and amid the death-like
72 appearance of the lady, the harsh look of the old man, and the cries of
63 the boy, Mr. Green left the grounds and returned to his hotel.
1 
70 Whilst seated by the window, and looking out upon the crowded street,
68 with every now and then the strange scene in the grave-yard vividly
68 before him, Mr. Green thought of the book he had been reading, and,
67 remembering that he had left it on the tomb, where he had suddenly
69 dropped it when called to the assistance of the lady, he immediately
66 determined to return in search of it. After a walk of some twenty
70 minutes, he was again over the spot where he had been an hour before,
71 and from which he had been so unceremoniously expelled by the old man.
69 He looked in vain for the book; it was no where to be found: nothing
72 save a bouquet which the lady had dropped, and which lay half-buried in
73 the grass from having been trodden upon, indicated that any one had been
70 there that evening. Mr. Green took up the bunch of flowers, and again
23 returned to the hotel.
1 
70 After passing a sleepless night, and hearing the clock strike six, he
72 dropped into a sweet sleep, from which he did not awake until roused by
70 the rap of a servant, who, entering his room, handed him a note which
71 ran as follows:--"Sir,--I owe you an apology for the inconveniences to
70 which you were subjected last evening, and if you will honour us with
73 your presence to dinner to-day at four o'clock, I shall be most happy to
68 give you due satisfaction. My servant will be in waiting for you at
70 half-past three. I am, sir, your obedt. servant, J. Devenant. October
27 23, to George Green, Esq."
1 
69 The servant who handed this note to Mr. Green, informed him that the
70 bearer was waiting for a reply. He immediately resolved to accept the
70 invitation, and replied accordingly. Who this person was, and how his
72 name and the hotel where he was stopping had been found out, was indeed
70 a mystery. However, he waited impatiently for the hour when he was to
65 see this new acquaintance, and get the mysterious meeting in the
19 grave-yard solved.
1 
71 The clock on a neighbouring church had scarcely ceased striking three,
72 when the servant announced that a carriage had called for Mr. Green. In
73 less than half an hour, he was seated in a most sumptuous barouch, drawn
70 by two beautiful iron greys, and rolling along over a splendid gravel
71 road, completely shaded by large trees which appeared to have been the
68 accumulating growth of many centuries. The carriage soon stopped in
69 front of a low villa, and this too was imbedded in magnificent trees
66 covered with moss. Mr. Green alighted and was shown into a superb
72 drawing room, the walls of which were hung with fine specimens from the
64 hands of the great Italian painters, and one by a German artist
65 representing a beautiful monkish legend connected with "The Holy
69 Catherine," and illustrious lady of Alexandria. The furniture had an
70 antique and dignified appearance. High backed chairs stood around the
69 room; a venerable mirror stood on the mantle-shelf; rich curtains of
72 crimson damask hung in folds at either side of the large windows; and a
66 rich Turkey carpet covered the floor. In the centre stood a table
68 covered with books, in the midst of which was an old fashioned vase
71 filled with fresh flowers, whose fragrance was exceedingly pleasant. A
72 faint light, together with the quietness of the hour gave beauty beyond
32 description to the whole scene.
1 
70 Mr. Green had scarcely seated himself upon the sofa, when the elderly
68 gentleman whom he had met the previous evening made his appearance,
70 followed by the little boy, and introduced himself as Mr. Devenant. A
70 moment more, and a lady--a beautiful brunette--dressed in black, with
68 long curls of a chesnut colour hanging down her cheeks, entered the
72 room. Her eyes were of a dark hazel, and her whole appearance indicated
73 that she was a native of a southern clime. The door at which she entered
70 was opposite to where the two gentlemen were seated. They immediately
71 rose; and Mr. Devenant was in the act of introducing her to Mr. Green,
70 when he observed that the latter had sunk back upon the sofa, and the
73 last word that he remembered to have heard was, "It is her." After this,
71 all was dark and dreamy: how long he remained in this condition it was
72 for another to tell. When he awoke, he found himself stretched upon the
64 sofa, with his boots off, his neckerchief removed, shirt collar
72 unbuttoned, and his head resting upon a pillow. By his side sat the old
71 man, with the smelling bottle in the one hand, and a glass of water in
72 the other, and the little boy standing at the foot of the sofa. As soon
67 as Mr. Green had so far recovered as to be able to speak, he said,
71 "Where am I, and what does this mean?" "Wait a while," replied the old
71 man, "and I will tell you all." After the lapse of some ten minutes he
71 rose from the sofa, adjusted his apparel, and said, "I am now ready to
73 hear anything you have to say." "You were born in America," said the old
67 man. "Yes," he replied. "And you were acquainted with a girl named
71 Mary," continued the old man. "Yes, and I loved her as I can love none
70 other." "The lady whom you met so mysteriously last evening is Mary,"
68 replied Mr. Devenant. George Green was silent, but the fountains of
65 mingled grief and joy stole out from beneath his eye lashes, and
68 glistened like pearls upon his pale and marble-like cheeks. At this
68 juncture the lady again entered the room. Mr. Green sprang from the
71 sofa, and they fell into each other's arms, to the surprise of the old
68 man and little George, and to the amusement of the servants who had
71 crept up one by one, and were hid behind the doors or loitering in the
69 hall. When they had given vent to their feelings, they resumed their
69 seats and each in turn related the adventures through which they had
69 passed. "How did you find out my name and address," asked Mr. Green?
70 "After you had left us in the grave-yard, our little George said, 'O,
69 mamma, if there aint a book!' and picked it up and brought it to us.
69 Papa opened it, and said 'the gentleman's name is written in it, and
70 here is a card of the Hotel de Leon, where I suppose he is stopping.'
72 Papa wished to leave the book, and said it was all a fancy of mine that
72 I had ever seen you before, but I was perfectly convinced that you were
68 my own George Green. Are you married?" "No, I am not." "Then, thank
72 God!" exclaimed Mrs. Devenant. The old man who had been silent all this
72 time, said, "Now, Sir, I must apologize for the trouble you were put to
70 last evening." "And you are single now." "Yes," she replied. "This is
69 indeed the Lord's doings," said Mr. Green, at the same time bursting
71 into a flood of tears. Although Mr. Devenant was past the age when men
71 should think upon matrimonial subjects, yet this scene brought vividly
73 before his eyes the days when he was a young man, and had a wife living,
68 and he thought it time to call their attention to dinner, which was
73 then waiting. We need scarcely add, that Mr. Green and Mrs. Devenant did
53 very little towards diminishing the dinner that day.
1 
67 After dinner the lovers (for such we have to call them) gave their
69 experience from the time that George Green left the gaol, dressed in
69 Mary's clothes. Up to that time, Mr. Green's was substantially as we
71 have related it. Mrs. Devenant's was as follows:--"The night after you
71 left the prison," said she, "I did not shut my eyes in sleep. The next
71 morning, about 8 o'clock, Peter, the gardener, came to the gaol to see
71 if I had been there the night before, and was informed that I had, and
69 that I left a little after dark. About an hour after, Mr. Green came
69 himself, and I need not say that he was much surprised on finding me
71 there, dressed in your clothes. This was the first tidings they had of
70 your escape." "What did Mr. Green say when he found that I had fled?"
69 "O!" continued Mrs. Devenant, "he said to me when no one was near, I
68 hope George will get off, but I fear you will have to suffer in his
68 stead. I told him that if it must be so I was willing to die if you
69 could live." At this moment George Green burst into tears, threw his
71 arms around her neck, and exclaimed, "I am glad I have waited so long,
37 with the hope of meeting you again."
1 
72 Mrs. Devenant again resumed her story:--"I was kept in gaol three days,
66 during which time I was visited by the Magistrates and two of the
72 Judges. On the third day I was taken out, and master told me that I was
71 liberated, upon condition that I be immediately sent out of the State.
62 There happened to be just at that time in the neighbourhood a
70 negro-trader, and he purchased me, and I was taken to New Orleans. On
69 the steam-boat we were kept in a close room where slaves are usually
72 confined, so that I saw nothing of the passengers on board or the towns
63 we passed. We arrived at New Orleans and were all put into the
71 slave-market for sale. I was examined by many persons, but none seemed
70 willing to purchase me; as all thought me too white, and said I would
72 run away and pass as a free white woman. On the second day while in the
70 slave-market, and while planters and others were examining slaves and
73 making their purchases, I observed a tall young man with long black hair
73 eyeing me very closely, and then talking to the trader. I felt sure that
70 my time had now come, but the day closed without my being sold. I did
67 not regret this, for I had heard that foreigners made the worst of
70 masters, and I felt confident that the man who eyed me so closely was
17 not an American.
1 
66 "The next day was the Sabbath. The bells called the people to the
73 different places of worship. Methodists sang, and Baptists immersed, and
73 Presbyterians sprinkled, and Episcopalians read their prayers, while the
70 ministers of the various sects preached that Christ died for all; yet
71 there were some twenty-five or thirty of us poor creatures confined in
71 the '_Negro Pen_' awaiting the close of the Holy Sabbath, and the dawn
72 of another day, to be again taken into the market, there to be examined
72 like so many beasts of burden. I need not tell you with what anxiety we
70 waited for the advent of another day. On Monday we were again brought
71 out, and placed in rows to be inspected; and fortunately for me, I was
67 sold before we had been on the stand an hour. I was purchased by a
73 gentleman residing in the city, for a waiting-maid for his wife, who was
65 just on the eve of starting for Mobile, to pay a visit to a near
70 relation. I was then dressed to suit the situation of a maid-servant;
73 and, upon the whole, I thought that in my new dress I looked as much the
21 lady as my mistress.
1 
70 "On the passage to Mobile, who should I see among the passengers, but
61 the tall, long-haired man that had eyed me so closely in the
66 slave-market a few days before. His eyes were again on me, and he
73 appeared anxious to speak to me, and I as reluctant to be spoken to. The
73 first evening after leaving New Orleans, soon after twilight had let her
71 curtain down, and pinned it with a star, and while I was seated on the
67 deck of the boat, near the ladies' cabin, looking upon the rippled
70 waves, and the reflection of the moon upon the sea, all at once I saw
73 the tall young man standing by my side. I immediately rose from my seat,
66 and was in the act of returning to the cabin, when he in a broken
71 accent said, 'Stop a moment; I wish to have a word with you. I am your
72 friend.' I stopped and looked him full in the face, and he said, 'I saw
64 you some days since in the slave-market, and I intended to have
69 purchased you to save you from the condition of a slave. I called on
70 Monday, but you had been sold and had left the market. I inquired and
70 learned who the purchaser was, and that you had to go to Mobile, so I
72 resolved to follow you. If you are willing, I will try and buy you from
73 your present owner, and you shall be free.' Although this was said in an
73 honest and off-hand manner, I could not believe the man to be sincere in
73 what he said. 'Why should you wish to set _me_ free?' I asked. 'I had an
71 only sister,' he replied, 'who died three years ago in France, and you
70 are so much like her, that had I not known of her death, I would most
69 certainly have taken you for her.' 'However much I may resemble your
71 sister, you are aware that I am not her, and why take so much interest
73 in one whom you never saw before?' 'The love,' said he, 'which I had for
69 my sister is transferred to you.' I had all along suspected that the
71 man was a knave, and this profession of love confirmed me in my former
40 belief, and I turned away and left him.
1 
67 "The next day, while standing in the cabin and looking through the
72 window, the French gentleman (for such he was) came to the window while
71 walking on the guards, and again commenced as on the previous evening.
72 He took from his pocket a bit of paper and put into my hand, and at the
68 same time saying, 'Take this, it may some day be of service to you,
69 remember it is from a friend,' and left me instantly. I unfolded the
70 paper, and found it to be a 100 dols. bank note, on the United States
68 Branch Bank, at Philadelphia. My first impulse was to give it to my
72 mistress, but upon a second thought, I resolved to seek an opportunity,
71 and to return the hundred dollars to the stranger. Therefore, I looked
69 for him, but in vain; and had almost given up the idea of seeing him
70 again, when he passed me on the guards of the boat and walked towards
72 the stem of the vessel. It being now dark, I approached him and offered
70 the money to him. He declined, saying at the same time, 'I gave it to
68 you--keep it.' 'I do not want it,' I said. 'Now,' said he, 'you had
71 better give your consent for me to purchase you, and you shall go with
73 me to France.' 'But you cannot buy me now,' I replied, 'for my master is
70 in New Orleans, and he purchased me not to sell, but to retain in his
71 own family.' 'Would you rather remain with your present mistress, than
67 be free?' 'No,' said I. 'Then fly with me to-night; we shall be in
69 Mobile in two hours from this, and, when the passengers are going on
70 shore, you can take my arm, and you can escape unobserved. The trader
69 who brought you to New Orleans exhibited to me a certificate of your
69 good character, and one from the Minister of the Church to which you
71 were attached in Virginia; and upon the faith of these assurances, and
72 the love I bear you, I promise before high heaven that I will marry you
71 as soon as it can be done.' This solemn promise, coupled with what had
71 already transpired, gave me confidence in the man; and rash as the act
69 may seem, I determined in an instant to go with him. My mistress had
70 been put under the charge of the captain; and as it would be past ten
71 o'clock when the steamer would land, she accepted an invitation of the
69 captain to remain on board with several other ladies till morning. I
72 dressed myself in my best clothes, and put a veil over my face, and was
72 ready on the landing of the boat. Surrounded by a number of passengers,
70 we descended the stage leading to the wharf and were soon lost in the
73 crowd that thronged the quay. As we went on shore we encountered several
70 persons announcing the names of hotels, the starting of boats for the
65 interior, and vessels bound for Europe. Among these was the ship
72 _Utica_, Captain Pell, bound for Havre. 'Now,' said Mr. Devenant, 'this
71 is our chance.' The ship was to sail at 12 o'clock that night, at high
65 tide; and following the men who were seeking passengers, we went
71 immediately on board. Devenant told the Captain of the ship that I was
69 his sister, and for such we passed during the voyage. At the hour of
58 twelve the _Utica_ set sail, and we were soon out at sea.
1 
69 "The morning after we left Mobile, Devenant met me as I came from my
71 state-room and embraced me for the first time. I loved him, but it was
68 only that affection which we have for one who has done us a lasting
71 favour: it was the love of gratitude rather than that of the heart. We
71 were five weeks on the sea, and yet the passage did not seem long, for
72 Devenant was so kind. On our arrival at Havre, we were married and came
49 to Dunkirk, and I have resided here ever since."
1 
72 At the close of this narrative, the clock struck ten, when the old man,
67 who was accustomed to retire at an early hour, rose to take leave,
72 saying at the same time, "I hope you will remain with us to-night." Mr.
69 Green would fain have excused himself, on the ground that they would
71 expect him and wait at the hotel, but a look from the lady told him to
69 accept the invitation. The old man was the father of Mrs. Devenant's
67 deceased husband, as you will no doubt long since have supposed. A
70 fortnight from the day on which they met in the grave-yard, Mr. Green
72 and Mrs. Devenant were joined in holy wedlock; so that George and Mary,
69 who had loved each other so ardently in their younger days, were now
71 husband and wife. Without becoming responsible for the truthfulness of
71 the above narrative, I give it to you, reader, as it was told to me in
50 January last, in France, by George Green himself.
1 
73 A celebrated writer has justly said of woman: "A woman's whole life is a
67 history of the affections. The heart is her world; it is there her
70 ambition strives for empire; it is there her avarice seeks for hidden
72 treasures. She sends forth her sympathies on adventure; she embarks her
72 whole soul in the traffic of affection; and if shipwrecked, her case is
48 hopeless--for it is a bankruptcy of the heart."
1 
72 Mary had every reason to believe that she would never see George again;
64 and although she confesses that the love she bore him was never
70 transferred to her first husband, we can scarcely find fault with her
68 for marrying Mr. Devenant. But the adherence of George Green to the
66 resolution never to marry, unless to his Mary, is, indeed, a rare
72 instance of the fidelity of man in the matter of love. We can but blush
69 for our country's shame, when we recall to mind the fact, that while
68 George and Mary Green, and numbers of other fugitives from American
71 slavery, can receive protection from any of the Governments of Europe,
65 they cannot return to their native land without becoming slaves.

71 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
67 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
70 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
72 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
72 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
65 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
69 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
68 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
65 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
1 
69 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
71 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
67 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
71 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
67 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
72 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
72 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
72 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
33 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
1 
74 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
69 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
71 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
65 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
73 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
74 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
69 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
71 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
67 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
69 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
74 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
73 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
69 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
68 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
67 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
1 
72 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
73 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
73 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
68 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
69 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
66 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
71 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
67 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
8 States.

1 
73 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
73 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

69 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
23 copied or distributed:

69 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
68 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
47 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
1 
73 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
72 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
72 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
71 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
69 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
72 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
71 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
67 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
67 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
7 1.E.9.
1 
72 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
71 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
72 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
72 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
66 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
72 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

74 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
71 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
71 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
68 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
71 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
41 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
1

64      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
70      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
66      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

71      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
66      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
57      License.  You must require such a user to return or
68      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
66      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
33      Project Gutenberg-tm works.
1 
72 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

44 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
1 
5 1.F.
1 
71 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
71 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
57 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
68 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
63 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
66 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
70 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
70 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
67 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
16 your equipment.
1 
72 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
68 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
64 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
67 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
64 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
66 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
66 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
65 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
62 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
70 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
71 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
70 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
8 DAMAGE.
1 
67 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
71 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
68 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
70 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
72 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
71 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
72 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
71 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
67 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
73 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
70 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
34 opportunities to fix the problem.
1 
72 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
72 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
73 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
58 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
1 
64 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
71 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
73 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
70 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
70 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
69 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
69 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
1 
72 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
65 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
72 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
72 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
69 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
71 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
73 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
72 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
69 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
57 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

67 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
1 
65 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
72 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
67 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
68 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
29 people in all walks of life.
1 
64 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
69 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
65 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
71 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
70 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
70 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

65 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
28 Literary Archive Foundation
1 
66 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
64 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
70 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
69 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
71 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
68 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
21 status with the IRS.
1 
66 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
66 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
64 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
70 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
67 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
67 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
61 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
67 particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate
1 
70 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
70 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
71 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
35 approach us with offers to donate.
1 
68 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
67 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
67 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
1 
66 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
68 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
65 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
37 donations.  To donate, please visit:

70 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
7 works.
1 
72 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
69 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
68 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
68 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
1 
67 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
66 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
68 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
61 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
